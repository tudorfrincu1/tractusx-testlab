## Patterns

<!-- Format: ### PAT-{n}: {Title} -->

### PAT-1: SSE stream module extraction
When `executionApi.ts` grew past 300 lines after adding reconnection, the SSE streaming logic (parser + `connectJobStream`) was extracted to `store/sseStream.ts`. The API file re-exports `connectJobStream` so callers don't need to change imports. SSE event *handlers* (type guards + dispatch) live in `store/sseEventHandlers.ts` to avoid circular deps with the Zustand store.

### PAT-2: Fire-and-forget API calls for immediate UI feedback
`cancel()` aborts the local stream immediately for instant UX, then POSTs to the backend endpoint as fire-and-forget. Pause/resume use `await` because the user needs feedback if the API call fails.

---

## Gotchas

<!-- Format: ### GOTCHA-{n}: {Title} -->

### GOTCHA-1: SSE event handler state types and circular deps
Extracting `handleSseEvent` from the store creates a potential circular import (`sseEventHandlers → useExecutionStore → sseEventHandlers`). Solution: define a narrow `SseHandlerState` interface in the handlers file instead of importing `ExecutionStore`. Zustand's `set()` accepts partials, so the narrow type is structurally compatible.

## API Quirks

<!-- Format: ### API-{n}: {Title} -->

### API-1: Backend execution API path migration
The backend migrated from `/testlab/run/` and `/testlab/jobs/` to `/testlab/test-execution/`. Key endpoints: `POST .../run/yaml` (submit), `GET .../{id}/stream` (SSE), `POST .../{id}/cancel|pause|resume`. Health stays at `/testlab/health`. SSE stream now includes `id:` lines for Last-Event-ID replay.
