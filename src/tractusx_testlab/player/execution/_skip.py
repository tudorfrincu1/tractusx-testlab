"""Skip-resolution helper — validates operator-requested skip IDs against the TCK.

Extracted from ``player.py`` to keep each module under 300 lines and to isolate
the pure skip-validation logic from the execution coordinator.

    Reads the ``skip_tests`` key from *runtime_vars* and cross-references it
    against the TCK's test entries.  Raises :class:`SkipNotAllowedError` before
    any test executes when:

    * A requested ID does not exist in the TCK's test list.
    * A requested ID exists but the entry is not marked ``skippable: true``.

    Args:

        runtime_vars: Optional runtime variable dict that may contain ``skip_tests``
            (a list of test-file IDs such as ``["test-cert.yaml"]``).

    Returns:
        Frozen set of test IDs the player must skip during this run.

    Raises:
        SkipNotAllowedError: If any requested test ID is unknown or not skippable.
