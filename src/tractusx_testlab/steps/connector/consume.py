"""Catalog, negotiation, and transfer steps — barrel re-export of the split modules.

The implementations live in dedicated modules along their responsibility seam:
``_dsp_consumer`` (DSP client), ``catalog_query`` (catalog steps),
``negotiate`` (contract negotiation step) and ``transfer`` (data transfer step).
Importing this module triggers all related ``@step`` registrations.
