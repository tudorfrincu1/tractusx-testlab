# Walkthrough

This walkthrough guides you through the complete Testlab lifecycle — from writing your first YAML test scripts, through compiling them into a portable `.testpkg` package, to executing tests and interpreting results.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this walkthrough, you will have:

1. **Written** two YAML test scripts that validate connector data exchange end-to-end
2. **Organized** them into a test case with shared variables and supporting assets
3. **Compiled** the test case into a distributable `.testpkg` package
4. **Executed** the tests against live connectors and reviewed the results

## Workflow Overview
