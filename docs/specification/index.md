# Testlab Extension Module — Requirements Specification

**Module:** `tractusx_sdk.extensions.testlab`
**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2026-03-30
**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

**TestLab** is the testing framework built into the [Tractus-X SDK](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-sdk). It enables you to author, compile, distribute, and execute automated TCKs against dataspace connectors and industry services — without writing any Python code.

Test authors write **declarative YAML tests** describing the steps to execute, the services to connect to, the assertions to evaluate, and the cleanup to perform. TestLab takes care of the rest: validation, encryption, packaging, execution, and structured reporting.

- **Tests** — YAML-defined test sequences composed of reusable, predefined steps
- **Compiler** — Validates tests at compile time and packages them into portable, encrypted-by-default `.tckpkg` artifacts
- **Player** — An async executor deployable as standalone CLI or embeddable in an existing application, with cryptographic identity for package authorization
- **Services** — Managed SDK service lifecycle for connector, provider, and DTR instances with automatic initialization and reuse across steps
- **Server** — FastAPI-based callback/webhook engine with dynamically mounted routes for async request/response patterns

Tests can declare long-lived services that persist for the test duration (avoiding repeated initialization), configure callback endpoints to receive async responses, and leverage runtime variable resolution. These tests are compiled with strict validation, packaged into distributable artifacts, and executed by the Player — which resolves runtime variables, manages step sequencing, evaluates assertions, orchestrates managed services, and provides live execution status.

Tests with steps like (e.g., `provision_asset`, `negotiate_contract`, `validate_aspect_model`) can be included inside of TCKs, which enable reusability and personalized configurations for different scenarios.

Example:

```yaml
# A minimal test — provision an asset and verify it was created
kind: test
name: my-first-test
version: "1.0"
dataspace_version: saturn

steps:
  - type: create_asset
    params:
      asset_id: "test-asset-001"
    expect:
      - type: STATUS_CODE
        value: 200
        severity: HARD
```

## Goals

| ID | Goal |
|----|------|
| G-1 | Enable test authors to define reusable, composable TCKs in YAML without writing Python code |
| G-2 | Provide a compile step that catches errors early — undeclared variables, incompatible step types, version mismatches — before execution |
| G-3 | Package compiled TCKs into portable `.tckpkg` artifacts that can be shared, uploaded, stored, and versioned |
| G-4 | Execute test packages at runtime via a singleton async Player, with support for loading from filesystem or programmatic input (dict/string) |
| G-5 | Provide real-time, step-level execution monitoring with in-memory state queryable at any point during execution |
| G-6 | Enforce dataspace version awareness — every script declares which dataspace version it targets, and steps are resolved accordingly |
| G-7 | Support configurable expected results (assertions) per step, with values sourced from inline YAML/JSON, files, or runtime variables |
| G-8 | Produce structured, machine-parseable logs (JSON-lines) alongside human-readable console output |
| G-9 | Ship a predefined step library covering Connector capabilities (provision, negotiate, transfer, consume, cleanup) and Industry capabilities (submodel consumption, aspect model validation, schema comparison) |
| G-10 | Support arbitrary dataplane API calls (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) authenticated via EDR tokens from prior steps |
| G-11 | Allow direct invocation of SDK module functions from YAML scripts via `sdk_call` step type, with a curated allowlist by default and an opt-in open mode |
| G-12 | Provide managed service lifecycle — scripts declare required SDK services (connector consumer, connector provider, DTR) that are initialized once and reused across steps |
| G-13 | Support async callback/webhook patterns — scripts can start a lightweight listener on an ephemeral endpoint, send a request, and await a response via `asyncio.Event` with configurable timeout |
| G-14 | Support dual deployment modes for the Player — standalone CLI (`testlab serve`) and embeddable library API (`TestlabPlayer.from_app(app)`) |
| G-15 | Secure `.tckpkg` artifacts via hybrid encryption (AES-256-GCM + RSA-OAEP) and Ed25519 signing, ensuring compiled packages can only be decrypted and executed by authorized Player instances |
| G-16 | Provide transparent service-step binding — steps reference managed services by name and the Player guarantees that the correct, pre-initialized SDK service instance is injected into each step |

## Non-Goals (Future Scope)

| ID | Non-Goal |
|----|----------|
| NG-1 | Full-featured REST API for test management (scheduling, user management) — the embedded server provides execution endpoints, package management (upload/list/delete), and callback routes |
| NG-2 | Persistent execution state in PostgreSQL (future — `SyncBackend` protocol) |
| NG-3 | Parallel step execution within a single script |
| NG-4 | Step retry policies (retry count, backoff strategy) |
| NG-5 | Cross-package script composition (`"!include"` across `.tckpkg` boundaries) |
