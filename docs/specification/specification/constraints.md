# Constraints & Verification

## Technical Constraints

| ID | Constraint |
|----|-----------|
| TC-01 | Python 3.12+ required |
| TC-02 | Async execution via native `asyncio` (no external task broker) |
| TC-03 | Pydantic 2.6+ for model validation |
| TC-04 | PyYAML 6.0+ for YAML parsing |
| TC-05 | No `eval()` or dynamic code execution from YAML scripts — variable resolution limited to `${var_name}` lookups |
| TC-06 | Connector steps SHALL reuse existing `tractusx_sdk.dataspace` services via `ServiceFactory` — no duplication of connector logic |
| TC-07 | `sdk_call` step operates in allowlist mode by default — only curated SDK functions may be invoked unless `allow_sdk_calls: open` is declared |
| TC-08 | FastAPI required for callback server and Player deployment modes (already an SDK dependency) |
| TC-09 | Callback routes are ephemeral — mounted on demand and unmounted after use. No persistent route state between script executions |
| TC-10 | Managed services SHALL use `ServiceFactory` for connector services and direct instantiation for DTR/AAS services — no custom service constructors |
| TC-11 | Python `cryptography` library required for all cryptographic operations (AES-256-GCM, RSA-OAEP, Ed25519). No custom cryptographic implementations permitted |
| TC-12 | Player keys SHALL be stored in `~/.testlab/keys/` with `0600` file permissions (private key). Trust store keys in `~/.testlab/trusted_compilers/`. Key directories SHALL be created automatically on first use |

## Quality Attributes

| Attribute | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Portability** | `.tckpkg` artifacts must be self-contained and executable on any machine with a compatible SDK version installed |
| **Extensibility** | Custom step types must be registrable without modifying SDK source code |
| **Observability** | Execution state must be queryable in real-time at step granularity; structured logs must be machine-parseable |
| **Safety** | Scripts parsed from untrusted sources (API, filesystem) must not allow arbitrary code execution. `sdk_call` in allowlist mode prevents access to internal SDK functions |
| **Reliability** | Cleanup steps must execute regardless of prior failures; resource leaks are unacceptable. Managed services must be torn down even on script failure |
| **Confidentiality** | Encrypted `.tckpkg` packages must be readable only by authorized Player instances. AES content keys must never be stored in plaintext. Private keys must be protected with appropriate file permissions |

## Verification Matrix

| ID | Verification | Type |
|----|-------------|------|
| V-01 | YAML parsing accepts valid scripts and rejects scripts missing `dataspace_version` | Unit |
| V-02 | Compiler fails on undeclared `${var}` references (not marked `runtime: true`) | Unit |
| V-03 | Compiler fails when step type doesn't exist in registry for the script's dataspace version | Unit |
| V-04 | Compile → package → unpack round-trip produces identical `CompiledTck` | Integration |
| V-05 | `.tckpkg` checksum is verified on load; tampered packages are rejected | Unit |
| V-06 | SDK version mismatch emits warning but does not block execution | Unit |
| V-07 | Player executes a compiled TCK and produces correct `TckResult` with step timings | Integration |
| V-08 | Step failure with `on_failure: abort` stops execution and runs cleanup | Integration |
| V-09 | Step failure with `on_failure: continue` proceeds to next step | Integration |
| V-10 | Step failure with `on_failure: skip_rest` skips remaining steps and runs cleanup | Integration |
| V-11 | Hard assertion failure causes step failure; soft assertion failure produces warning | Unit |
| V-12 | Assertion values from inline, file, and variable sources are resolved correctly | Unit |
| V-13 | JSON strings embedded in YAML are auto-parsed before assertion comparison | Unit |
| V-14 | `${var}` references are resolved correctly across steps (output of step N used by step N+1) | Integration |
| V-15 | Runtime variables override defaults at execution time | Unit |
| V-16 | Two TCKs running concurrently have isolated contexts and no variable leakage | Integration |
| V-17 | Script cancellation stops after current step and runs cleanup | Integration |
| V-18 | Monitor returns correct current step, status, and assertion results during execution | Integration |
| V-19 | JSON-lines log file contains correct entries with script_id, dataspace_version, step names | Integration |
| V-20 | Log file is renamed with `_PASS`/`_FAIL` suffix on completion | Integration |
| V-21 | `dataplane_call` step supports GET/POST/PUT/DELETE with custom headers, query params, and body | Integration |
| V-22 | `dataplane_call` step auto-injects EDR authorization header | Unit |
| V-23 | Custom step registered at runtime via `registry.register()` is available to scripts | Unit |
| V-24 | `sdk_call` in allowlist mode rejects functions not in the allowlist | Unit |
| V-25 | `sdk_call` in open mode (`allow_sdk_calls: open`) allows any `tractusx_sdk` function | Unit |
| V-26 | `sdk_call` correctly invokes an SDK function and stores the return value in context | Integration |
| V-27 | Managed services declared in `services` block are initialized before first step and torn down after completion | Integration |
| V-28 | `context.get_service("name")` returns the same cached instance across multiple steps | Unit |
| V-29 | `init_service` step replaces an existing service and `stop_service` tears it down | Integration |
| V-30 | Callback endpoint receives a POST, signals `asyncio.Event`, and `await_callback` step receives the payload | Integration |
| V-31 | `await_callback` step times out correctly when no callback is received within `timeout_s` | Integration |
| V-32 | Encrypted `.tckpkg` round-trip: compile with `--encrypt` → authorized Player decrypts and executes successfully | Integration |
| V-33 | Unauthorized Player (key not in `authorized_players`) is rejected with `PackageAuthorizationError` | Unit |
| V-34 | Tampered encrypted package (modified `payload.enc`) fails AES-256-GCM decryption | Unit |
| V-35 | Package signed by untrusted compiler (key not in trust store) is rejected with `PackageSignatureError` | Unit |
| V-36 | Package with invalid Ed25519 signature (modified after signing) is rejected | Unit |
| V-37 | `testlab keygen` generates valid RSA key pair and stores in `~/.testlab/keys/` with correct permissions | Unit |
| V-38 | Service-step type validation: `provision_asset` with `CONNECTOR_CONSUMER` service raises `ServiceTypeMismatchError` | Unit |
| V-39 | Service resolution priority: `params.service` takes precedence over direct `params.base_url`; absence of both raises `StepConfigError` | Unit |
