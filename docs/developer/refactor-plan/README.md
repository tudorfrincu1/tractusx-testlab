# Refactor Plan — Index

This effort is a **structural-only** refactor of the TestLab codebases. It changes
*where code lives and how modules are organized* — never *what the code does*. No
behavior, output, or contract changes ship as part of this work.

The refactor is split by codebase ownership. Each codebase has its own detailed
plan; this page is the shared contract and status tracker that binds them together.

## Objectives & Guiding Principles

**The goal is a deeply modular codebase — not merely "split files over 300 lines."**
Every concern (hooks, helpers, stores, sync, serialization, transforms, views, and
their sub-concerns) becomes a **module in its own right**: a folder with a single
nameable responsibility and its own barrel as public surface, nested into
sub-modules within sub-modules wherever a real responsibility seam exists.
Modularity is the objective; file size is only one of several triggers.

1. **Deep modularity by design.** Code is organized into small, single-responsibility
   modules with clear, typed boundaries, nested as deep as real seams require. We
   design for modularity up front — we do not bolt it on after the fact. A cohesive
   file that bundles two responsibilities is two modules, even if it is small.
2. **The 300-line limit is one trigger, not the goal.** Triggers that reveal a
   missing module are: (a) a file bundling more than one responsibility — even well
   under 300 lines; (b) a flat folder whose siblings obviously cluster by concern;
   (c) a file exceeding 300 lines (the loudest, last-resort trigger); (d) the same
   logic appearing twice. We split along responsibility seams — never by arbitrarily
   cutting a file in half.
3. **Single responsibility.** Every module, function, hook, and class does one
   thing. One concern per file; one nameable purpose per module.
4. **No over-engineering (guardrail).** Nest **only** where a real, nameable seam
   exists. Do not create single-function "modules" just to add depth, do not split a
   cohesive unit, and do not invent a folder holding one stray file. The boring,
   readable structure a human can navigate wins over artificial depth.
5. **Data-driven, no hardcoding.** Anything that enumerates options, types, or
   configuration comes from data (catalog JSON, config, lookups), never inline
   string literals or hardcoded lists.
6. **Concern-based folders + barrels.** Folders group by *concern*, not by file
   type. Each module exposes a barrel `index.ts`/`__init__.py` as its public
   surface; consumers import the barrel, never deep internals. Cross-module
   references inside the same area use direct relative paths to avoid barrel cycles.
7. **Reuse over duplication.** If the same logic appears twice, it is extracted
   into one importable module. Splitting a file must *produce reusable units*, not
   two coupled halves.
8. **NO behavior or appearance change.** Every phase is verified green against the
   existing test suite and type checker before and after, and (for the IDE) proven
   pixel-identical in the live browser. A phase that changes a test assertion or a
   generated artifact is out of scope and must be rejected.

## Refactor Charter

These are **non-negotiable directives** from the Chief Architect. They govern every
phase in every codebase. Any work that violates them is out of scope and must be
rejected — no exceptions.

1. **This is a REFACTOR, not a redesign.** No new features. We change where code
   lives and how it is organized — never what the product does.
2. **Behavior- AND appearance-preserving.** The IDE must **look** the same and
   **work** the same: identical layout, styling, Blockly theme, panels, and
   interactions. The backend must keep the **same** API contracts, CLI surface,
   runtime behavior, and compiled `.stck` output. Nothing the user or an integrator
   can observe may change.
3. **Stability is paramount.** The product must remain stable throughout. Each phase
   ships green (type check, build, full test suite) and visually unchanged — no
   phase may leave the product in a broken or half-migrated state.
4. **Legacy removal IS allowed and encouraged.** Dead code, unused functions,
   orphaned files, and superseded implementations with **zero importers/callers**
   may be deleted. Deleting unreachable code is behavior-preserving and is part of
   reaching production-ready quality.
5. **Write code like a human programmer, for a human maintainer.** Use descriptive
   names for variables, methods, classes, and types. Keep logic simple, linear, and
   easy to read and understand. The end goal is code a **human** will maintain — if
   an AI writes it so complex, clever, or over-abstracted that a human cannot easily
   understand it, it is wrong. Favor the boring, obvious, readable solution over the
   clever one. Readability and maintainability outrank cleverness, brevity, and
   premature optimization.
6. **End goal: PRODUCTION-READY code** — clean, concise, modular. Same product,
   better internal structure.

### Execution Discipline

How the charter directives above are carried out, phase by phase. These are equally
non-negotiable.

1. **Step by step, but safe.** Move in small, reversible steps. After each step,
   verify the product still builds, still passes tests, and (for the IDE) still
   looks and behaves identically. Never a big-bang rewrite verified only at the end.
2. **Verify before declaring done.** Each phase must prove it changed neither
   appearance nor functionality. For the **backend**, that proof is a passing
   contract/test-suite check. For the **IDE**, a green `tsc`/`vite build` is
   explicitly **not** sufficient: no phase is "done" until the live app has been run
   in a browser, the affected views captured as a BEFORE screenshot set, the real
   interactions exercised, then re-captured AFTER and compared pixel-for-pixel —
   using the `visual-regression-guard` skill. Verify one feature/area at a time: run
   it, confirm it works, refactor it, re-verify it looks and behaves identically,
   THEN move to the next area — never refactor several areas and inspect only at the
   very end. Any visible difference or broken interaction is a regression: fix it,
   never explain it away. A passing build alone never satisfies this gate.
3. **Parallelize safely.** Running multiple specialist agents in parallel is
   encouraged **only** when their work cannot conflict — disjoint files/folders, no
   unmet dependency, no shared frozen contract. Frontend and backend are always safe
   to run together. Agents must share knowledge as they go — record findings and
   decisions in shared notes and update the phase-status table promptly — so they
   build on each other instead of duplicating or contradicting work.
4. **No over-engineering. Be time-effective.** Do the simplest change that satisfies
   the phase. No speculative abstractions, no "while I'm here" extras. The plan
   defines scope — execute exactly that, efficiently.
5. **Exclude `docs/` from the refactor.** Do not modify or take guidance from the
   existing `docs/` content — it describes the OLD structure and would introduce
   bias. The only documentation that defines the target is the refactor plan in
   `docs/developer/refactor-plan/`. The sole `docs/` files a phase may touch are the
   refactor-plan files themselves (e.g. the phase-status table). Syncing the old docs
   to the new structure is a separate, later task.

## Boundary Table — Who Owns What

| Codebase | Owner agent | Root | Detailed plan |
|----------|-------------|------|---------------|
| Frontend IDE | `testlab-ide-master` | `ide/src/` | [ide-refactor-plan.md](ide-refactor-plan.md) |
| Python library | `testlab-master` | `src/tractusx_testlab/` | [backend-refactor-plan.md](backend-refactor-plan.md) |

Neither owner may modify the other codebase. Work that touches both is coordinated
through the shared contracts below.

## Shared Cross-Codebase Contracts

These are the boundaries the two codebases meet at. **Neither side may change them
unilaterally.** A change to any of these is a *contract change*, not a structural
refactor, and is therefore out of scope for this effort — unless it ships in
lockstep across both codebases with coordinated review.

| Contract | Frontend touch point | Backend touch point | Rule |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|------|
| **YAML v2 syntax** (`@variable`, step shape, phases) | `services/yaml/` (`modelToYaml`, `yamlToModel`) | `scripting/`, `compiler/` parser | Field names, ordering semantics, and variable syntax are frozen. Refactors may relocate the mapping code but must emit byte-identical YAML. |
| **Block catalog schema + `classes.json` taxonomy** | `public/blocks/**`, `blocks/registration/`, `toolbox/` | catalog consumed during compile validation | Block JSON shape, category taxonomy, and param-type names are frozen. Reorganizing loaders/registration must not alter the manifest contract. |
| **TCK env / services manifest model** | `features/environment-editor/`, `store/environment/`, `models/environment.ts` | env/services manifest reader | The manifest field model is frozen. Both sides serialize/deserialize the same shape. |
| **Compiled `.stck` package format** | export feature / compile API client | `compiler/` packager | The package layout and contents are frozen. The frontend only triggers and consumes it. |

**Lockstep rule:** changes to the **serialization ↔ YAML ↔ compiler** boundary
(the chain that turns blocks into YAML into a compiled package) ship together in a
single coordinated change set, reviewed by both `testlab-ide-master` and
`testlab-master`. No partial landing on one side.

## Phase Status

Legend: ⬜ not started · 🟡 in progress · ✅ done

### Frontend — see [ide-refactor-plan.md](ide-refactor-plan.md)

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0 | Remove dead legacy `components/BlockEditor/` tree | ✅ |
| 1 | Split `serialization/serialize/workspaceToModel.ts` (303); outputs organized into nested `serialize/{reader,writer,validation}/` modules (one module per responsibility, no flat dump) | ✅ |
| 2 | Split `hooks/useBlocklyWorkspace.ts` (301→70) into `useBlocklyInit` / `useBlocklyStoreSync` / `useBlocklyResize` + shared `blocklyWorkspaceRefs` (flat hooks per §2 tree); composer returns identical shape — pixel + YAML-hash identical, gates green | ✅ |
| 3 | Dissolve kitchen-sink `serialization/helpers.ts` into `serializationParts/` | ✅ Split into `serializationParts/{workspaceBlockFactory,blockFieldAccessors,valueBlockBuilders,structuralBlockBuilders,assertionChainBuilders}` + barrel; deleted dead `helpers/` folder; YAML + pixel identical |
| 4 | Decompose `populate/populateTest.ts` switch into per-param populators | ✅ Replaced 13-arm `switch (p.type)` with data-driven `paramPopulators/` module (one `<type>ParamPopulator.ts` per param type + `paramPopulatorRegistry.ts` + barrel); `populateTest.ts` 288→209, dispatches via `resolveParamPopulator`; YAML hash-identical (f9ef27da), pixel-identical, console clean |
| 5 | Modularize `serialization/populate/` → nested per-responsibility modules | ✅ Extracted the real 3-file seam into `populate/assertions/` (`assertionPopulators` ← `populateAssertions`, `assertionGrouping`, `assertionNormalization`) + barrel. Per the §2.4 guardrail, `populateFilterExpressions.ts` and `stepOutputTracker.ts` stay as cohesive single-responsibility leaves at `populate/` root — folding each into its own folder would be a banned single-file module. YAML hash-identical (f9ef27da), pixel-identical, console clean |
| 6 | Modularize `block-editor/fields/` → per-field modules (`wrappedText/`, `templateString/`) | ✅ Moved `FieldWrappedText`+`bubblePatch`+`wrappedTextDialog` into `fields/wrappedText/` (git mv, history kept) + barrel; `fields/index.ts` re-exports both module barrels. 5 importers rerouted to the `wrappedText/` module barrel. YAML hash-identical (f25163d4), pixel-identical, console clean |
| 7 | Split `blocks/common/catalog/` → `loader/` + `variables/` | ✅ Moved `variableCollection`+`typedVariableCollection` into `catalog/variables/` module + barrel; `catalogLoader.ts` stays at catalog root (single-file guardrail). Created `catalog/index.ts` barrel re-exporting both. 6 importers rerouted. YAML hash-identical (b3fe9dd4), pixel-identical, console clean. Plan reconciliation: `loader/` folder omitted (would be a banned single-file module) |
| 8 | Remove dead root-level block duplicates (`blocks/catalogBlocks.ts`, `blocks/valueBlocks.ts`) | ✅ Deleted both (246+277 lines, zero importers); superseded by `registration/steps/catalogBlocks.ts` and `registration/values/valueBlocks.ts`. Pixel-identical (SHA1 `9679a85f`), console clean |
| 9 | Modularize `features/environment-editor/` → `services/ variables/ preview/ shared/` | ✅ Moved into `services/` (ServicesSection, ServiceCard, InternalServiceCard, ExternalServiceCard, FieldWithToggle + ServiceCard.css), `variables/` (VariablesSection, VariableRow + VariablesTable.css), `preview/` (YamlPreviewSection, yamlPreview); each module has barrel `index.ts`. Plan reconciliation: `shared/` omitted — FieldWithToggle's only consumers are service cards so it joins `services/` (single-file module guardrail). Screenshot byte-identical (813e04e9), YAML identical, console clean |
| 10 | Modularize `features/tck-dashboard/dataflow/` (18 files) → `graph/ panels/ builder/` | ✅ |
| 11 | Modularize `features/preconditions/` → `modal/ list/ rules/` | ✅ Moved `AddPreconditionModal` into `modal/`, `PreconditionsList`+`PreconditionEditor` into `list/`, `RuleSection`+`ConstraintRow`+`templatePolicies` into `rules/`; each module has barrel `index.ts`. `PreconditionsPanel.tsx` stays at root as composition entry. Import-chain impact internal only. Pixel-identical, console clean |
| 12 | Modularize `features/project-explorer/` → `tree/ contextMenu/ actions/` | ✅ Moved `TreeRow`+`ExplorerHeader`+`useTestDragReorder` into `tree/`, `ExplorerContextMenu`+`ExplorerContextMenuParts`+`explorerContextMenuTypes` into `contextMenu/`, `ExplorerActions` into `actions/`; each module has barrel `index.ts`. `ProjectExplorer.tsx` stays at root as composition entry. Import-chain impact internal only. Pixel-identical, console clean |
| 13 | Modularize `features/yaml-editor/` → `editors/` + `VariablePicker/` + setup | ✅ Moved `MonacoEditor`+`SchemaEditor`+`TestdataEditor`+`TestdataEditorHelpers`(→`testdataEditorTransforms`) into `editors/` module + barrel; `VariablePicker/` kept as own module; `monacoSetup.ts` stays at root. 1 external importer (`EditorPanels`) rerouted to feature barrel. Pixel-identical, console clean |
| 14 | Decompose `models/schema.ts` → `models/schema/` per-concern modules | ✅ Split into `schema/{assertionSchema,phaseSchema,testSchema}` + barrel; 281→73+128+139; all consumers unaffected (barrel surface identical). Pixel-identical, console clean |
| 15 | Modularize `store/selectors/` + tidy slice barrels | ✅ Split `selectors.ts` into per-domain modules (`variableSelectors`, `testSelectors`); renamed `helpers.ts` → `storeBuilders.ts` (descriptive); barrel surface unchanged. All 7 slice folders confirmed with own barrel. Pixel-identical, console clean |
| 16 | Move pure project I/O from `store/project/` to `services/project/` | ✅ Created `services/project/` module (6 files): `projectImportExport`, `projectExportTransforms`, `exampleProjectLoader`, `projectImportTransforms`, `projectFilePersistence`, `projectDocumentParser` + barrel. Moved `SchemaFile`/`TestdataFile`/`ActiveFile` types to `models/project.ts`. Store persistence now delegates to service layer. Deleted dead `documentLoader.ts`. Layer compliance verified: services/ imports only models/, store/ imports services/. YAML hash byte-identical, pixel-identical, console clean |
| 17 | Centralize model↔YAML field mapping (de-dup `modelToYaml`/`yamlToModel`) | ✅ |
| 18 | Descriptive-name sweep (remaining generic file names) | ✅ Renamed 9 files: `store/types`→`store.types`, `bottom-panel/types`→`bottomPanel.types`, `workspaceTypes`→`blocklyWorkspace.types`, `graphHelpers`→`dependencyGraphNodeBuilders`, `assertionHelpers`→`assertionBlockResolvers`, `validationHelpers`→`validationBlockReaders`, `builder/constants`→`dataspaceOptions`, `builder/types`→`pipelineGraph.types`, `templateString/types`→`templateSegment.types`. All importers updated. Pixel-identical, console clean |
| 19 | Consolidate all styling into SCSS under `assets/styles/` | ✅ Full. Pass 1: renamed 67 `.css`→`.scss`, scaffold. Pass 2 (19b): migrated all 67 co-located SCSS into centralized `assets/styles/{base,layout,components,features}/` partials, wired `main.scss` as sole entry (imported in `app/main.tsx`), removed all co-located imports, deleted all co-located `.scss` files. Zero `.scss`/`.css` outside `assets/styles/`. Pixel-identical, build clean |
| 20 | Enforce barrels + naming + style guards (lint) | ✅ Created missing barrels (`shared/index.ts`, `features/index.ts`). Rewrote all 67 deep `@/store/*/…` imports in features/ and layout/ to use `@/store` barrel. Fixed layout→feature deep paths to use feature barrels. Added `ActiveFile` type to `store/project/` barrel. Installed ESLint + `typescript-eslint`, configured `no-restricted-imports` to ban `@/store/*/*` and `@/features/*/*` patterns. Added `VariablePicker`/`TestdataVariableButton` to `yaml-editor` barrel. Zero lint violations, pixel-identical, console clean |

### Backend — see [backend-refactor-plan.md](backend-refactor-plan.md)

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Split `steps/connector/consume.py` → `_dsp_consumer` + `catalog_query` + `dsp/negotiate` + `dsp/transfer`; `consume.py` → barrel | ✅ |
| 2 | Dedup `player/execution/_phase_runners.py` → `execution/phases/` (one `_run_phase` driver + setup/main/teardown wrappers) | ⬜ |
| 3 | Isolate `steps/conditions.py` grammar → `_condition_parsing.py`; `conditions.py` orchestration only | ⬜ |
| 4 | Dedupe `steps/precondition/policy_config.py` → `_policy_builders.py` (Jupiter/Saturn ODRL) | ⬜ |
| 5 | Nest `steps/_checks.py` → `steps/_checks/` (status · equality · json_path · extraction) | ⬜ |
| 6 | Nest `compiler/` → `compiler/ir/` + `compiler/validation/` | ⬜ |
| 7 | Split `services/manager.py` → `_factory.py` (creation) + `manager.py` (lifecycle) | ⬜ |
| 8 | Nest `server/` → `server/routes/` + `server/streaming/` | ⬜ |
| 9 | Extract `player/execution/player.py` trace formatting → `_trace_formatter.py` | ⬜ |
| 10 | Watch-list guard — record near-limit files in repo memory (no moves) | ⬜ |
| 11 | Conditional `models/` nesting (`enums/`, `results/`) — only if families separate cleanly | ⬜ |
