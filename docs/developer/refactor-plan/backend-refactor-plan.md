# Backend Refactor Plan — `src/tractusx_testlab/`

> All phases obey the Refactor Charter in [README.md](./README.md) — structural-only, no new features, same API contracts / CLI / runtime behavior / `.stck` output, stable throughout, legacy/dead code removal allowed, end goal production-ready (clean, concise, modular).

> **Scope:** structural-only. No behavior, no contract, no `.stck`/CLI/API change.
> Every phase ends green on the test suite and type/lint checks. See
> [README.md](./README.md) for shared contracts and the lockstep rule.

The backend already has a clean **layered** package layout (`models/ · services/ ·
steps/ · compiler/ · player/ · server/ · …`) and zero files over 300 lines. This
plan now drives that architecture all the way down: **every concern becomes a
module in its own right, nested as deep as real responsibility seams require.**

---

## 0. Objective — a deeply modular backend

**The goal is a deeply modular backend, not merely "split files over 300 lines."**

Every concern — step domains, compile passes, IR assembly, validation rules,
expression grammar, server routes, streaming, model groups, and service wiring —
becomes a **module in its own right**: a package with a single nameable
responsibility, its own barrel (`__init__.py`) as public surface, and freedom to
nest into **sub-packages within sub-packages** wherever a real seam exists.
Modularity is the objective; file size is only one of several triggers that reveal
where modularity is missing.

**Triggers that signal a module is needed** (any one is sufficient):

1. **A file bundles more than one nameable responsibility** — even well under 300
   lines. A 180-line module that holds an orchestrator *plus* its grammar regexes
   *plus* parse helpers is three modules wearing one filename.
2. **A package is a flat dump of siblings** that obviously cluster by concern (e.g.
   one `compiler/` folder mixing IR assembly, lowering passes, and validation
   rules that are really *ir/* + *validation/* sub-packages).
3. **A file exceeds 300 lines** — the loudest trigger, but the *last* one to rely
   on. By the time a module is oversized, the missing seams are already obvious.
4. **The same logic appears twice** (e.g. three phase loops re-implementing one
   per-step iteration) — extract it into one importable module.

**This plan therefore covers the whole backend**, not only today's near-limit
files. Sub-300 modules and flat packages that bundle responsibilities are
modularized too.

### Guardrail — no over-engineering (non-negotiable)

Nest **only** where a real, nameable responsibility seam exists. Each module must
have a single nameable purpose and a minimal public surface. **Do not** create a
single-function "module" just to add depth, do not split a cohesive unit, and do
not invent a package that holds one stray file with no sibling concern (unless the
§2 tree defines that seam). A private helper used by exactly one module stays a
`_helper.py` next to its caller — it does not become a package. The boring,
readable structure a human can navigate always wins over artificial depth.

### Doctrine — behavior + contract unchanged

Modularization is **purely structural**. No phase changes runtime behavior, the
compiled `.stck` output, the CLI surface, the HTTP API, or any observable contract.
Every phase is a **pure move + barrel re-export** — public import paths
(`from tractusx_testlab... import ...`) are preserved, tests are unchanged, and the
`@step(...)` registry resolves every moved step type as before. The 300-line
acceptance check in §6 remains, but it is a **floor**, not the target — passing it
does not mean a package is modular.

> **Baseline note (test suite):** there is a known set of **20 pre-existing CCM
> fixture-path failures** (`test_ccm_compile_all.py`, `test_ccm_integration_parsing.py`)
> caused by concurrent `docs/examples` renames and an empty `tests/fixtures/` — they
> are **unrelated to this refactor** and out of scope here. A phase is "green" when
> it introduces **no new** failures beyond this baseline.

---

## 1. Current-State Assessment

The backend is **already layered and healthy** — but layering is not the same as
deep modularity. Several packages are still **flat dumps** of single-concern files
that should cluster into sub-packages, and a few modules **bundle two
responsibilities** under one filename. Those are the seams this plan targets.
Baseline metrics (verified 2026-05-29):

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Files exceeding 300 lines | **0** |
| `except Exception` / bare `except:` | **0** |
| `print(` (excluding `_fingerprint`) | **0** |
| Layered package layout | Intact (12 top-level layers) |

This is **not** a rescue refactor — the layers are sound. But "no file over 300
lines" is a **floor, not the goal**. The work below makes the backend *deeply*
modular: flat single-concern packages gain sub-packages along real seams, and the
handful of files that bundle two responsibilities split into focused modules. The
near-limit files are simply the loudest of these triggers.

### 1a. Near-limit watch list (actual line counts)

These files are within ~40 lines of the 300 limit. They are the **loudest**
trigger, but not the only one — several already double as multi-responsibility
modules (§1b/§1c).

| File | Lines | Status |
|------|------:|--------|
| [compiler/_ir_helpers.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/compiler/_ir_helpers.py) | 299 | Split into `compiler/ir/` (Phase 6) |
| [server/streaming.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/server/streaming.py) | 298 | Split into `server/streaming/` (Phase 8) |
| [player/execution/player.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/player/execution/player.py) | 298 | Extract trace/result formatting (Phase 9) |
| [compiler/ir_builder.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/compiler/ir_builder.py) | 278 | Split into `compiler/ir/` (Phase 6) |
| [server/routes.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/server/routes.py) | 271 | Split into `server/routes/` (Phase 8) |
| [steps/conditions.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/steps/conditions.py) | 267 | Grammar isolation (Phase 3) |
| [player/loading/_parser.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/player/loading/_parser.py) | 267 | Watch (Phase 10 watch-list) |
| [services/manager.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/services/manager.py) | 262 | Split factory vs lifecycle (Phase 7) |
| [cli/compile.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/cli/compile.py) | 260 | Watch (Phase 10 watch-list) |
| [steps/_checks.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/steps/_checks.py) | 213 | Split into `steps/_checks/` (Phase 5) |

### 1b. Multi-responsibility files (below the limit, but bundling concerns)

These are not near the limit, but mix two concerns under one roof. Extracting the
secondary concern improves reuse and testability without changing behavior.

- **[steps/connector/consume.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/steps/connector/consume.py)** — *(✅ Phase 1, done)* split into `_dsp_consumer.py` + `catalog_query.py` + `negotiate.py` + `transfer.py`; `consume.py` is now a barrel.
- **[player/execution/_phase_runners.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/player/execution/_phase_runners.py)** (180 lines) — `execute_setup_steps`, `execute_main_steps`, `execute_teardown_steps` each re-implement the same per-step loop (monitor → condition gate → resolve step class → run → collect). *(Phase 2)*
- **[steps/conditions.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/steps/conditions.py)** — `ConditionEvaluator` plus **eight** module-level compiled regexes and parsing free-functions for the `${{ ... }}` / legacy `${ }` expression grammar. *(Phase 3)*
- **[steps/precondition/policy_config.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/steps/precondition/policy_config.py)** — `_build_jupiter_policy` and `_build_saturn_policy` are two version-specific ODRL body builders embedded next to the step class. *(Phase 4)*
- **[steps/_checks.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/steps/_checks.py)** (213) — bundles distinct check families (status/equality/JSONPath/schema) that the assertion + condition steps share; cluster into a `steps/_checks/` package. *(Phase 5)*
- **[services/manager.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/services/manager.py)** (262) — service **factory/creation** wiring mixed with **lifecycle** (start/stop/own) management. *(Phase 7)*
- **[player/execution/player.py](../../../src/tractusx_testlab/player/execution/player.py)** (298) — orchestration mixed with result/execution-trace **formatting**; extract the formatter. *(Phase 9)*

### 1c. Flat packages that should nest (deep-modularity targets)

These packages are **single-layer dumps** whose files obviously cluster by
sub-concern. Each becomes a small set of nested sub-packages along the seam — the
core of the deep-modularity goal beyond the oversized-file triggers.

| Package | Today (flat) | Real sub-concerns → sub-packages | Phase |
|---------|--------------|----------------------------------|:-----:|
| `compiler/` | 10 sibling files (orchestrator + IR assembly + lowering + validation + assets + expressions + fingerprint) | `ir/` (builder, helpers, assets, lowering) · `validation/` (validator, rules, expressions) · top-level orchestrator/packager/fingerprint | 6 |
| `server/` | 9 sibling files (app + routes + compile + callbacks + streaming + buffer + registry + storage) | `routes/` (route groups: compile/run/callback) · `streaming/` (SSE formatter + lifecycle + buffer) · top-level app/storage/registry | 8 |
| `models/` | 8 flat domain files | keep flat **unless** a file bundles groups: `enums.py` (service/phase/state enum families) and `results.py` (step + assertion + trace results) are the only nest candidates → `enums/`, `results/` | 11 |
| `scripting/` | script + parser + registry + `_builders` | builders cluster (`_builders.py`) → `_builders/` only if it grows; otherwise leave — **guardrail check** | 10 (watch) |

> **Guardrail reminder:** `config/`, `logging/`, `syntax/`, `security/crypto`,
> `security/trust`, `services/participants.py`, and the already-nested `player/`,
> `steps/connector|industry|precondition|utility|server|pull_data` packages are
> **already correctly modular** — they are explicitly **out of scope**. Do not nest
> them further; there is no real seam to add.

## 2. Target Architecture

The layered structure is **confirmed**. This section defines the **complete nested
end-state** the migration phases (§4) converge to — not just the top-level layers,
but every meaningful sub-package down to the responsibility seam. Items marked
**(new)** are introduced by a phase; everything else exists today. Each directory
owns one concern and exposes its public surface via a barrel `__init__.py`.

### 2.1 Layering & import rules (apply at every depth)

The dependency arrows point **one way only** — inner layers never import outer ones:

```
syntax  ──▶  (leaf: pure constants, no testlab imports)
models  ──▶  syntax
config  ──▶  models, syntax
security ─▶  models
services ─▶  models, config, security        (SDK service wiring)
steps   ──▶  models, services, syntax, config (NEVER imports player/server/cli)
compiler ─▶  models, syntax, steps (registry only)
player  ──▶  steps, services, models, config, compiler
server  ──▶  player, compiler, services, models
cli     ──▶  compiler, player, server, config   (thinnest layer, top of stack)
```

Rules enforced by these arrows:

- **`steps/` is the keystone** — it depends *downward* on `models`/`services`/`syntax`
  but is imported *upward* by `compiler` (for `@step` registry validation) and
  `player` (for execution). A step module must **never** import from `player/`,
  `server/`, or `cli/`.
- **`models/` holds no behavior** — only Pydantic data, enums, exceptions. Anything
  with logic belongs in `services`, `steps`, `compiler`, or `player`.
- **`__init__.py` is a barrel only** at every level — it re-exports the package's
  public surface and contains **no logic**. Sub-packages re-export their leaves so
  callers import `from ...steps.connector import QueryCatalogStep`, never the file.
- **Private helpers** (`_*.py`) are package-internal — never re-exported through the
  barrel, never imported across package boundaries.

### 2.3 Where the structure changes (seam, not arbitrary cut)

Every change below extracts a **reusable** unit along a responsibility seam (detail
in §3/§4) — never an arbitrary line-count cut:

**Mixed-concern file splits:**
- `steps/connector/consume.py` (5 steps + helper) → `_dsp_consumer.py` + `catalog_query.py`
  + `dsp/negotiate.py` + `dsp/transfer.py`; `consume.py` becomes a barrel. *(✅ Phase 1)*
- `player/execution/_phase_runners.py` (3 near-identical loops) → `execution/phases/`
  with one `_run_phase.py` driver and thin `setup/main/teardown` wrappers. *(Phase 2)*
- `steps/conditions.py` (orchestration + grammar) → `_condition_parsing.py` (grammar)
  + `conditions.py` (orchestration only). *(Phase 3)*
- `steps/precondition/policy_config.py` (step + 2 builders) → `_policy_builders.py`. *(Phase 4)*
- `services/manager.py` (factory + lifecycle) → `_factory.py` + `manager.py` facade. *(Phase 7)*
- `player/execution/player.py` (orchestration + trace formatting) → `_trace_formatter.py`. *(Phase 9)*

**Flat-package → nested sub-packages:**
- `steps/_checks.py` (+ `_json_path_validation.py`, `_path_extraction.py`) → `steps/_checks/`
  (status / equality / json_path / extraction). *(Phase 5)*
- `compiler/` flat → `compiler/ir/` (builder + helpers + assets + lowering) and
  `compiler/validation/` (validator + rules + expressions). *(Phase 6)*
- `server/` flat → `server/routes/` (compile / callbacks / mock groups) and
  `server/streaming/` (lifecycle + formatter + buffer). *(Phase 8)*
- `models/enums.py` → `models/enums/`; `models/results.py` → `models/results/` —
  **only if** the families are genuinely separable (guardrail check at execution). *(Phase 11)*

### Layer-boundary notes (blur to watch, not fix-now)

- **`steps/execution` import direction:** `_phase_runners.py` imports `run_step` /
  `store_step_outputs` from `step_runner` via **function-local imports** to dodge a
  circular import. This is a smell, but resolving it means re-ordering module
  dependencies — out of scope for a structural-only pass. Document it; do not
  rewire it now.
- **`compiler` ↔ `player/loading`:** both parse YAML-ish input (`ir_builder` /
  `_ir_helpers` vs `loading/_parser`). The boundary is correct (compile-time vs
  run-time), but the **expression/condition grammar** is the one rule set that
  must stay single-sourced (see Phase 3) to avoid drift between compile validation
  and runtime evaluation.

No layer needs to be created, merged, or moved.

## 3. Module / Responsibility Map

| Module | Current responsibility | Proposed split (seam) |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| `steps/connector/consume.py` *(✅ done)* | DSP consumer helper + 5 step classes | `_dsp_consumer.py` + `catalog_query.py` + `dsp/negotiate.py` + `dsp/transfer.py`; barrel re-export |
| `player/execution/_phase_runners.py` | 3 near-identical phase loops | Extract shared `async _run_phase(...)`; setup/main/teardown become thin wrappers in `execution/phases/` |
| `steps/conditions.py` | `ConditionEvaluator` + regex grammar + parse helpers | `_condition_parsing.py` (regexes + `_evaluate_*`); `conditions.py` keeps orchestration only |
| `steps/precondition/policy_config.py` | step class + Jupiter/Saturn policy builders | `_policy_builders.py` (both builders + shared ODRL scaffolding); step class stays |
| `steps/_checks.py` (+ `_json_path_validation`, `_path_extraction`) | 4 check families in flat files | `steps/_checks/` package: `status.py` · `equality.py` · `json_path.py` · `extraction.py` |
| `compiler/` (10 flat files) | orchestrator + IR + validation mixed at one level | `compiler/ir/` (builder/helpers/assets/compilation) + `compiler/validation/` (validator/rules/expressions); orchestrator + packager + fingerprint stay top-level |
| `services/manager.py` (262) | SDK service **creation** + **lifecycle** | `_factory.py` (create connector/discovery/AAS) + `manager.py` facade (own/start/stop) |
| `server/` (9 flat files) | app + route groups + SSE + storage mixed | `server/routes/` (compile/callbacks/mock) + `server/streaming/` (lifecycle/formatter/buffer); app/storage/registry stay top-level |
| `player/execution/player.py` (298) | orchestration + trace/result formatting | extract `_trace_formatter.py`; `player.py` keeps orchestration |
| `models/enums.py`, `models/results.py` | bundled enum/result families | `models/enums/`, `models/results/` **only if** families separate cleanly (guardrail check) |
| `player/loading/_parser.py` (267), `cli/compile.py` (260), `scripting/_builders.py` | near-limit / cohesive | **Watch only** (Phase 10) — split-first rule on next feature touch; no move now |

---

## 4. Migration Phases (leaf-first, deep modularity)

Ordered so each step is independent and leaf-first (no module is split before its
dependents are stable). Every phase is a **pure move + barrel re-export** — public
import paths preserved, tests unchanged, `@step(...)` registry unaffected. Phases
1–4 split the mixed-concern files; phases 5–9 carry deep modularity across the rest
of the backend (flat packages and bundled responsibilities); phases 10–11 are the
watch-list guard and the conditional model nesting.

#### Phase ordering & status

| # | Phase | Target (seam) | Priority | Status |
|---|-------|---------------|:--------:|:------:|
| 1 | `consume.py` split | `_dsp_consumer.py` + `catalog_query.py` + `dsp/negotiate.py` + `dsp/transfer.py`; `consume.py` → barrel | P1 | **Done** ✅ |
| 2 | `_phase_runners.py` dedup | `execution/phases/` — one `_run_phase` driver + thin setup/main/teardown wrappers | P1 | Pending |
| 3 | `conditions.py` grammar isolation | `_condition_parsing.py` (regexes + `_evaluate_*`); `conditions.py` orchestration only | P2 | Pending |
| 4 | `policy_config.py` dedupe | `_policy_builders.py` (Jupiter/Saturn ODRL builders) | P2 | Pending |
| 5 | `steps/_checks/` package | nest check families: `status` · `equality` · `json_path` · `extraction` | P2 | Pending |
| 6 | `compiler/` nesting | `compiler/ir/` (builder/helpers/assets/compilation) + `compiler/validation/` (validator/rules/expressions) | P2 | Pending |
| 7 | `services/manager.py` split | `_factory.py` (SDK service creation) + `manager.py` lifecycle facade | P2 | Pending |
| 8 | `server/` nesting | `server/routes/` (compile/callbacks/mock) + `server/streaming/` (lifecycle/formatter/buffer) | P2 | Pending |
| 9 | `player/execution/player.py` split | extract `_trace_formatter.py`; `player.py` keeps orchestration | P3 | Pending |
| 10 | Watch-list guard | no moves — record watch list (`_parser.py`, `cli/compile.py`, `_builders.py`) in repo memory | P3 | Pending |
| 11 | `models/` conditional nesting | `models/enums/`, `models/results/` **only if** the families separate cleanly (guardrail) | P3 | Pending |

### Phase 1 — `steps/connector/consume.py` (P1, at limit) ✅
1. Create `steps/connector/_dsp_consumer.py`; move `_DspConsumer`.
2. Create `steps/connector/catalog_query.py`; move the three `QueryCatalog*` steps.
3. Move `NegotiateContractStep` → `negotiate.py`, `TransferDataStep` → `transfer.py`.
4. Turn `consume.py` (or `connector/__init__.py`) into a barrel re-export so the
   `@step(...)` registry and existing imports resolve unchanged.
5. `pytest -x -q` — connector + integration suites green. **(done; no new failures)**

### Phase 2 — `player/execution/_phase_runners.py` (P1, dedup)
1. Create `player/execution/phases/` with `_run_phase.py` holding one private
   `async _run_phase(*, script, phase, stop_on_failure, gate_conditions, ...)`.
2. Add thin `setup.py` / `main.py` / `teardown.py` wrappers configuring policy
   (setup & main stop on failure + gate on `if_condition`; teardown unconditional);
   `phases/__init__.py` re-exports `run_setup` / `run_main` / `run_teardown`.
3. Keep the existing function-local `step_runner` imports (do not rewire circular
   dependency in this pass).
4. `pytest -x -q` — runner / execution / precondition-execution suites green.

### Phase 3 — `steps/conditions.py` (P2, grammar isolation)
1. Create `steps/_condition_parsing.py`; move the 8 compiled regexes and
   `_evaluate_status_fn` / `_evaluate_step_outcome` / comparison helpers.
2. `conditions.py` imports from it; `ConditionEvaluator` keeps orchestration only.
3. This single-sources the expression grammar referenced by compile-time
   validation and runtime evaluation — guard against drift.
4. `pytest -x -q` — condition / sse / pause-resume suites green.

### Phase 4 — `steps/precondition/policy_config.py` (P2, dedupe)
1. Create `steps/precondition/_policy_builders.py`; move both version builders +
   shared ODRL scaffolding (constraint/permission assembly).
2. `policy_config.py` keeps the `@step` class only.
3. `pytest -x -q` — precondition policy/contract suites green.

### Phase 5 — `steps/_checks/` package (P2, flat → nested)
1. Create `steps/_checks/` package; move check families into `status.py`,
   `equality.py`, plus the existing `_json_path_validation.py` → `json_path.py` and
   `_path_extraction.py` → `extraction.py`.
2. `steps/_checks/__init__.py` re-exports the same names the old flat module
   exposed, so `assertions.py` / `conditions.py` imports resolve unchanged.
3. **Guardrail check:** if a family is a single cohesive function, leave it as one
   file — do not create a one-function module.
4. `pytest -x -q` — assertion / condition / step-executor suites green.

### Phase 6 — `compiler/` nesting (P2, flat → nested)
1. Create `compiler/ir/` and move `ir_builder.py` → `ir/builder.py`,
   `_ir_helpers.py` → `ir/_helpers.py`, `_assets.py` → `ir/_assets.py`,
   `_ir_compilation.py` → `ir/_compilation.py`; `ir/__init__.py` exposes `build_ir`.
2. Create `compiler/validation/` and move `validator.py` → `validation/validator.py`,
   `_validation.py` → `validation/_rules.py`, `_expressions.py` →
   `validation/_expressions.py`; `validation/__init__.py` exposes `Validator`.
3. `compiler/__init__.py` re-exports `Compiler`, `Validator`, `Packager` unchanged;
   `compiler.py`, `packager.py`, `_fingerprint.py` stay top-level.
4. `pytest -x -q` — compiler / compile-endpoint / CCM-compile suites green (no new
   failures beyond the baseline CCM fixture-path set).

### Phase 7 — `services/manager.py` split (P2, factory vs lifecycle)
1. Create `services/_factory.py`; move SDK connector/discovery/AAS **creation**
   wiring (`ServiceFactory` calls) out of `manager.py`.
2. `manager.py` keeps the `ServiceManager` **lifecycle** facade (own/start/stop)
   and delegates creation to `_factory.py`.
3. `pytest -x -q` — participant / service-manager / mock-server suites green.

### Phase 8 — `server/` nesting (P2, flat → nested)
1. Create `server/routes/`; move `compile.py` → `routes/compile.py`,
   `callbacks.py` → `routes/callbacks.py`, and the `routes.py` handlers →
   `routes/mock.py`; `routes/__init__.py` exposes `register_routes(app)`.
2. Create `server/streaming/`; split `streaming.py` into `streaming/lifecycle.py`
   (connection open/close/keepalive) + `streaming/formatter.py` (event → SSE wire)
   and move `_event_buffer.py` → `streaming/_event_buffer.py`.
3. `server/__init__.py` and `app.py` wiring re-export/import the same public names;
   `app.py`, `storage.py`, `mock_registry.py` stay top-level.
4. `pytest -x -q` — health / compile-endpoint / sse-streaming / pause-resume-event
   suites green.

### Phase 9 — `player/execution/player.py` split (P3, extract formatter)
1. Create `player/execution/_trace_formatter.py`; move result/execution-trace
   formatting out of `player.py`.
2. `player.py` keeps orchestration and calls the formatter.
3. `pytest -x -q` — runner / sse-streaming / test-runner suites green.

### Phase 10 — Watch-list guard (P3, no-op unless touched)
No moves now. Record the watch list (`player/loading/_parser.py` 267,
`cli/compile.py` 260, `scripting/_builders.py` 208 + §1a) in repo memory so the
**next** feature touching any near-limit file triggers a split-first rule rather
than an overflow.

### Phase 11 — `models/` conditional nesting (P3, guardrail-gated)
1. Inspect `models/enums.py` and `models/results.py` at execution time. **Only if**
   each holds genuinely separable families (e.g. service enums vs phase enums; step
   results vs trace models) create `models/enums/` and `models/results/` with the
   families as leaf modules and a barrel re-exporting every name.
2. **Guardrail:** if a file is one cohesive set of related models, leave it flat —
   nesting cohesive data into one-file packages is over-engineering and is rejected.
3. `pytest -x -q` — model / compiler / runner suites green.

## 5. Risks

**Overall risk: LOW.** Every phase is a mechanical move-and-re-export with no logic
change, validated by the existing suite.

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Step `@step(...)` registry breaks if a moved module isn't imported | Medium | Keep barrel re-exports in `consume.py` / `connector/__init__.py` / `_checks/__init__.py`; assert registry membership in tests after each phase |
| Circular-import regression in `player/execution` | Medium | Preserve existing function-local imports in `_phase_runners`; do **not** rewire in this pass |
| Condition-grammar drift between compile & runtime | Medium | Phase 3 single-sources the grammar in one module; both callers import it |
| Hidden behavior change during dedupe/extraction (Phases 2, 4, 7, 9) | Low | Pure extraction; identical inputs/outputs; suite is the gate |
| Package nesting breaks a public import path (Phases 5, 6, 8, 11) | Medium | Barrel `__init__.py` re-exports every previously public name; run the full suite after each move |
| Over-nesting cohesive code into one-file packages | Low | Guardrail check per phase (§0); leave flat with a one-line reason when no seam exists |

### Cross-codebase contract touch points (ship in lockstep with frontend)

These serialization ↔ YAML ↔ compiler boundaries are **contracts shared with the
IDE**. This plan does **not** change them — but any future change here must ship
together with the frontend agent's matching change:

- **YAML v2 syntax** (`@variable_name` refs, `${{ }}` expressions) — touched
  indirectly by Phase 3 (grammar isolation). Verify no token/precedence change.
- **Block schema** (`ide/public/blocks/**`) — step `type` strings are the join key;
  renames are forbidden in a structural pass.
- **TCK manifest model** — compiler input contract; untouched.
- **`.stck` package format** — compiler output contract; untouched.

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

All must hold after **every** phase (run from repo root). The line-count check is a
**floor, not the goal** — passing it does not mean a package is deeply modular; the
structural checks below are what prove the objective.

```bash
# 1. No source file exceeds 300 lines (floor, not the objective)
find src -name '*.py' | xargs wc -l | awk '$1>300 && !/total/'   # → empty

# 2. No broad exception handling
grep -rn "except Exception:\|except:" src/ --include="*.py"      # → empty

# 3. No print statements
grep -rn "print(" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v "_fingerprint" # → empty

# 4. Test suite introduces NO NEW failures beyond the baseline
python -m pytest tests/ -q   # → only the 20 pre-existing CCM fixture-path failures
```

> **Baseline:** the suite carries **20 known CCM fixture-path failures** unrelated
> to this refactor (see §0). A phase passes when the failing-test set is **identical
> before and after** — never larger. Do not attempt to fix the baseline here.

Plus structural checks (the real proof of the objective):

- [ ] **Deep modularity:** every flat package called out in §1c is nested along its
      real seam (or explicitly left flat by the guardrail with a one-line reason).
- [ ] Layered package layout intact; barrels (`__init__.py`) expose public surface only.
- [ ] Each new sub-package has a single nameable responsibility and a minimal public surface.
- [ ] **No over-engineering:** no single-function "module", no one-file package added
      purely for depth (guardrail held).
- [ ] Step `@step(...)` registry resolves all moved step types unchanged.
- [ ] No public import path broken (existing `from tractusx_testlab...` imports still resolve).
- [ ] Condition grammar single-sourced in one module.
- [ ] Each split is a responsibility seam (one concern per new file/package), not an arbitrary cut.
