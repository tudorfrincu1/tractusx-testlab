# ADR-0008: Test-Case to TCK Rename

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-05-13

## Context

The product concept "test case" was too generic and caused multiple problems:

- **Naming collision**: Python's `unittest.Tck` made class naming awkward and confusing in code.
- **Conceptual ambiguity**: users couldn't tell whether "test case" meant the overarching container or an individual test script inside it.
- **Weak product identity**: the name didn't communicate that this is a Technology Compatibility Kit for certification testing.

The product scope (`docs/developer/product-scope.md`) defines these containers as conformance test packages that validate Tractus-X standard implementations against a specification version.

## Decision

Rename the overarching container concept from **"test-case"** to **"tck"** (Technology Compatibility Kit).

Specific changes:

- YAML `kind: test-case` → `kind: tck`
- All Python class names: `Tck` → `Tck` (e.g., `TckModel`, `TckCompiler`)
- All method/variable names: `test_case` → `tck`
- File extension: `.testpkg` → `.tckpkg`
- UI labels: "Test Case" → "TCK"
- Individual "test" scripts within a TCK keep their name unchanged

**No backward compatibility** — this is a clean break at this early stage.

## Consequences

**Positive**:

- Clearer product identity — users immediately understand this is certification tooling
- No naming collision with `unittest.Tck`
- Aligns terminology with industry-standard "TCK" concept (Java TCK, Jakarta TCK)

**Negative**:

- Breaking change for existing YAML files (must update `kind:` field)
- localStorage saved projects in the IDE are invalidated
- All documentation, examples, and tutorials must be updated
