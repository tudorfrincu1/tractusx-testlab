# ADR-0021: Remove the Precondition Concept in Favor of Unified Variables

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-06-08

## Context

TestLab carried two unrelated authoring mechanisms for everything a test needs
before its steps run:

- **Preconditions** — a separate step family (`precondition/*`), a `preconditions:`
  manifest block, and a dedicated `PRECONDITION` execution phase. A
  `precondition/provide` step inlined a value (typically an access policy) so
  later steps could reference it.
- **Variables** — typed definitions declared in `index.yaml` under
  `env.variables` and referenced through `${{ env.<id>.<field> }}`.

The two overlapped: a `precondition/provide` policy and an `env.variables`
policy described the same thing in two different ways. ADR-0018 (Unified
Variables Model) proposed expressing preconditions *as* complex variables but
kept a backward-compatible precondition path. For the production release we want
**one** way to declare prerequisites.

The unified-variables approach has been proven end to end: the
`certificate-management-v2.0` example
(`ide/public/examples/certificate-management-v2.0/`) was migrated so that every
test pulls its access policy from a single env variable. Zero preconditions
remain in that example.

## Decision

We remove the precondition concept entirely. This is an intentional breaking
change, not a deprecation.

Removed:

- The `precondition/*` step family — `precondition/provide`,
  `precondition/generate`, `precondition/input`, `precondition/inject/connector`,
  and any other `precondition/*` verb.
- The `preconditions:` manifest block.
- The `PRECONDITION` execution phase and its runner.
- All related models, schema, IDE blocks/UI, and documentation.

Legacy `precondition/*` YAML is **no longer accepted**. The compiler rejects it
rather than translating it.

### Replacement mapping

| Was (precondition) | Now (variables) |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| `precondition/provide` inlining a policy | A complex variable in `index.yaml` `env.variables` with `uses: config/connector/policy` |
| Reference to the provided policy | `${{ env.<id>.policy }}` |
| Data pulled "from a precondition" | A `connector/pull_data_filtered` step consuming `with.policy: ${{ env.<id>.policy }}` |

A policy is declared once:

```yaml
env:
  variables:
    - id: ccm_usage_policy
      uses: config/connector/policy
      name: Required CCMAPI Usage Policy
      with:
        value: { permissions: [ ... ] }
      returns:
        policy:
          type: object
          class: Policy
```

and referenced wherever a step needs it:

```yaml
- id: pull_data_1
  uses: connector/pull_data_filtered
  with:
    policy: ${{ env.ccm_usage_policy.policy }}
    # ...
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- One authoring concept for prerequisites. A policy is declared once and
  referenced everywhere, instead of being inlined per test.
- Less surface area: no separate phase, runner, block family, or schema branch
  to maintain.
- Prerequisites become first-class typed variables, reusable across TCKs and
  standard versions.

### Negative

- Breaking for any existing test YAML that uses preconditions. Such tests must
  be migrated before they compile or run.
- Historical compiled artifacts and execution traces that contain
  `precondition/*` sources or a `precondition` phase no longer reflect the
  current model.

### Neutral

- Migration is mechanical: move each precondition-provided value into
  `env.variables` and repoint references to `${{ env.<id>.<field> }}`.
- Reference migrations: the `certificate-management-v2.0` (CCM) example is the
  policy-variable reference; the `connector-ping-v1.0` and `dtr-ping-v1.0`
  examples are precondition-free TCKs.

## Supersedes

This ADR supersedes the precondition-related decisions:

- [ADR-0004 — Precondition as Distinct Step Phase](ADR-0004-precondition-as-distinct-step-phase.md)
- [ADR-0007 — Precondition Execution Logs Model](ADR-0007-precondition-execution-logs-model.md)
- [ADR-0013 — Preconditions Specification](ADR-0013-preconditions-specification.md)

It affirms and finalizes [ADR-0018 — Unified Variables Model](ADR-0018-unified-variables-model.md):
the unified-variables model remains the way to declare prerequisites, and this
ADR removes the backward-compatible precondition path that ADR-0018 had retained.
