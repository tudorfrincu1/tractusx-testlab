# ADR-0004: Precondition as Distinct Step Phase

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-05-13

## Context

Preconditions run before setup. They do not call APIs — they generate execution logs instructing users what to configure in external systems. Two modeling options:

1. Sub-phase of Setup — precondition blocks live inside the setup container.
2. Distinct phase — `PRECONDITION` is a first-class phase with its own runner.

Preconditions differ from setup: they produce instructions rather than performing actions, and their failure semantics differ (skip setup+main but still run cleanup).

## Decision

Add a new `StepPhase.PRECONDITION` enum value. Implement a separate `execute_precondition_steps()` runner. Execution order becomes: precondition → setup → main → cleanup.

Precondition steps use dedicated executor classes that produce `PreconditionLog` entries instead of making HTTP calls.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clean phase boundary — preconditions are not conflated with setup actions.
- Precondition results are clearly identifiable in `ScriptResult`.
- Precondition failure skips setup and main while still running cleanup.

### Negative

- Slightly more complex player logic (four phases instead of three).
- Phase enum grows — all phase-aware code must handle the new value.

### Neutral

- Precondition blocks get their own toolbox phase section.
- YAML format gains a `preconditions:` key at test-case level.
