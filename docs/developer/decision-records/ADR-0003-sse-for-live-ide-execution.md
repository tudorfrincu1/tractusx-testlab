# ADR-0003: SSE for Live IDE Execution

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-05-13

## Context

The IDE needs real-time step execution visualization. The backend `ExecutionMonitor` already emits granular events (step start, step complete, assertion result, error). Three transport options were evaluated:

1. **WebSocket**: bidirectional, complex setup, requires connection management.
2. **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: unidirectional server→client, simple, auto-reconnect.
3. **REST polling**: simple but introduces latency and unnecessary load.

The IDE only needs to receive events — it never sends data back during execution.

## Decision

Use Server-Sent Events via FastAPI `StreamingResponse` on the backend and browser `fetch` with `ReadableStream` on the frontend. Event types map directly to `ExecutionMonitor` event kinds.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Simpler than WebSocket — no bidirectional connection management needed.
- Native browser `EventSource` provides auto-reconnect.
- No additional dependencies on either side.
- Works through HTTP proxies and CDNs without special configuration.

### Negative

- No bidirectional messaging — if future features need client→server during execution, a separate mechanism is required.
- Limited to ~6 concurrent connections per domain in some browsers (mitigated by HTTP/2).

### Neutral

- Event format uses standard SSE `data:` lines with JSON payloads.
- Connection lifecycle tied to test execution duration.
