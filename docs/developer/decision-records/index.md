# Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document significant technical decisions made during the development of Tractus-X TestLab.

## Format

Each ADR follows the [Michael Nygard format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions):

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Status | Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded |
| Date | When the decision was made |
| Context | Forces at play and constraints |
| Decision | What was decided |
| Consequences | Trade-offs accepted |

## Records

ADRs are grouped by the part of the system they primarily affect: the **backend** Python
library (`src/tractusx_testlab/`) or **shared** concerns that span the system. The
[template](ADR-0000-template.md) lives at the root of this folder.

| [0021](shared/ADR-0021-remove-precondition-concept.md) | Remove the Precondition Concept in Favor of Unified Variables | Accepted |

### Deprecated / Superseded

These ADRs are not published and remain as plain-text history only.

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 0004 | Precondition as Distinct Step Phase | Superseded by [0021](shared/ADR-0021-remove-precondition-concept.md) (not published) |
| 0006 | Service Auto-Declaration on Block Drop | Deprecated (not published) |
| 0007 | Precondition Execution Logs Model | Superseded by [0021](shared/ADR-0021-remove-precondition-concept.md) (not published) |
| 0013 | Preconditions Specification | Superseded by [0021](shared/ADR-0021-remove-precondition-concept.md) (not published) |

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy `ADR-0000-template.md` to `ADR-NNNN-short-title.md` (next available number).
2. Fill in all sections.
3. Place the file in the correct subfolder — `frontend/`, `backend/`, or `shared/` — based on which part of the system the decision primarily affects.
4. Add the entry to the matching subsection in this index table, using the subfolder path (for example `[NNNN](backend/ADR-NNNN-short-title.md)`).
5. Add the file to `mkdocs.yml` under the Decision Records nav section, in the matching `Frontend:` / `Backend:` / `Shared:` group.
