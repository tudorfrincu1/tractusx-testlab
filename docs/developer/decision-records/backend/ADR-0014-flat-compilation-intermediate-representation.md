# ADR-0014: Flat Compilation Intermediate Representation (IR)

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-05-21 (updated 2026-05-28)

## Based On

- [ADR-0010 — YAML Syntax v2](../shared/ADR-0010-yaml-syntax-v2.md)
- [ADR-0011 — Environment and Services](../shared/ADR-0011-environment-and-services.md)
- [ADR-0012 — Compilation and Packaging](ADR-0012-compilation-and-packaging.md)
- ADR-0013 — Preconditions Specification (superseded, not published)

## Context

The TestLab compilation pipeline (ADR-0012) transforms YAML v2 source files into a portable package. However, the internal representation between the compiler output and the Player input has not been formally specified. Without a well-defined Intermediate Representation (IR), the compiler and Player are tightly coupled — changes to one break the other, and tooling (debuggers, trace viewers, decompilers) cannot interoperate.

### Forces

- The **compiler** must perform ALL intelligence: variable resolution, type checking, reference validation, phase flattening, and assertion wiring. It emits a fully-resolved, self-describing output.
- The **Player** must be dumb: iterate instructions sequentially, resolve `$ref` values from a flat dictionary, dispatch step executors, store outputs, and run inline assertions. Zero parsing, zero graph traversal, zero ambiguity resolution at runtime.
- The IR must be **decompilable** back to source YAML without data loss (supporting round-trip editing).
- The IR must support **O(1) variable lookup** at runtime — no tree walking or scope chain resolution.
- The IR must be **self-describing** — every instruction carries enough metadata to be understood in isolation (phase, position, type, expected inputs/outputs).
- The IR must support **structured tracing** — every instruction has a stable `index` that correlates compiled IR to execution trace logs.
- The format must be **JSON-serializable** for embedding in `.tckpkg` archives, streaming over SSE, and storage in databases.

### Design Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| Flat instruction array | No recursion, no nesting, no conditional branches at IR level |
| All references pre-resolved | `${{ }}` syntax does not exist in the IR — only `$ref` objects |
| Phase metadata preserved | Each instruction knows its origin phase for decompilation |
| Inline assertions | Validation blocks are properties of their parent instruction, not separate instructions |
| Deterministic ordering | Same source YAML always produces the same IR (byte-identical with same compiler version) |
| Forward-reference prohibition | `produced_by` index must always be less than the consumer's index |

## Decision

### 1. Design Philosophy

The Flat Compilation IR follows three core principles:

**1.1 Compiler Does All Thinking**

The compiler is the intelligent component. It resolves all variable references, validates type compatibility, checks temporal ordering (no forward references), inlines testdata, resolves service configurations, and flattens the three-phase structure (setup → steps → teardown) into a single ordered instruction array. The compiled output is a **fully-resolved execution plan** — the Player performs zero interpretation.

**1.2 Flat Structures Only**

The IR uses two primary data structures:

- **Symbol table**: A flat dictionary mapping canonical keys to symbol metadata. O(1) lookup by key.
- **Instructions**: A flat ordered array. The Player iterates index 0 to N-1, no branching, no recursion.

There are no nested scopes, no scope chains, no tree structures that require traversal at runtime.

**1.3 Self-Describing Instructions**

Every instruction carries all metadata needed to:
- Execute it (type, parameters, timeout)
- Trace it (index, id, phase)
- Decompile it (phase, phase_index)
- Handle failures (on_failure strategy)
- Validate its results (inline assertions)

An instruction can be extracted from the array and understood in isolation — no external context is required beyond the symbol table values.

---

### 2. Two-File Compilation Output

The compiler produces **two files** — not a standalone JSON per test:

| File | Purpose | Contains |
|------|---------|----------|
| `manifest.yaml` | Package metadata, integrity, test registry | TCK identity, compilation fingerprint, test list |
| `tck-execution.json` | Execution payload | env, tests, preconditions, all compiled tests |

#### 2.1 `manifest.yaml` Schema

```yaml
kind: manifest

package:
  format: tckpkg
  format_version: "1.0.0"
  testlab: v1-alpha

tck:
  id: "<tck-id>"
  namespace: "<namespace>"
  metadata:
    name: "<string>"
    version: "<string>"
    description: "<string>"
    authors: [...]
    copyright_holders: [...]
    license: Apache-2.0
    standards: [...]
    tags: [...]
    dataspace_version: "<string>"

compilation:
  compiled_at: "<ISO 8601 UTC>"
  compiler_version: "<semver>"
  fingerprint:
    nonce: "blake2b:<hex>"        # unique per compilation (blake2b of random bytes)
    public_key: "ed25519:<base64>" # persistent compiler installation key
    checksum: "blake2b:<hex>"      # blake2b hash of tck-execution.json

tests:                             # NOT present in encrypted mode
  - id: "<test-id>"
    file: "<source path>"
    source_hash: "blake2b:<hex>"
```

**Key fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `kind` | Always `manifest` — identifies the file type |
| `package.format` | Always `tckpkg` |
| `compilation.fingerprint.nonce` | blake2b hash of random bytes — unique per compilation |
| `compilation.fingerprint.public_key` | Ed25519 public key of the compiler installation |
| `compilation.fingerprint.checksum` | blake2b hash of the entire `tck-execution.json` content |
| `tests` | Registry of compiled tests with source hashes (omitted in encrypted mode) |

#### 2.2 `tck-execution.json` Schema

```json
{
  "env": {
    "variables": [...],
    "services": [...],
    "schemas": {...},
    "testdata": {...}
  },
  "tests": [
    { "id": "<test-id>", "file": "<source path>", "source_hash": "blake2b:<hex>" }
  ],
  "preconditions": [
    { "id": "...", "uses": "...", "name": "...", "with": {...}, "returns": {...}, "seed": {...} }
  ],
  "compiled_tests": [
    {
      "id": "<test-id>",
      "metadata": { "name": "...", "version": "...", "description": "..." },
      "symbol_table": { "<canonical_key>": {...} },
      "instructions": [ {...}, {...} ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Root-level sections:**

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `env` | Shared environment: variables, services, schemas (asset refs), testdata (asset refs) |
| `tests` | Test registry with source file paths and integrity hashes |
| `preconditions` | Pre-execution requirements (at root level, NOT inside `env`). May include `seed` mapping (see ADR-0013 §10) |
| `compiled_tests` | Array of compiled test units — the core IR |

#### 2.3 `compiled_tests[]` Entry (CompiledTest)

Each entry in `compiled_tests` represents one compiled test:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | Test identifier (lowercase kebab-case) |
| `metadata` | object | Yes | Human-readable metadata (name, version, description) |
| `symbol_table` | object | Yes | Flat dictionary of all symbols for this test (see §5) |
| `instructions` | array | Yes | Ordered array of instruction objects (see §4) |

!!! note "No duplication of package-level fields"
    `compiled_tests` entries do NOT contain `format_version`, `compiled_at`, `compiler_version`, `namespace`, or `testlab`. Those belong exclusively in the manifest.

---

### 3. Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| All tests in one `tck-execution.json` | Single file load, atomic execution, simpler Player |
| `id` field name (not `test_id`) | Consistent naming across all objects |
| Preconditions at root level | They apply to ALL tests, not to a specific env |
| blake2b hashing (not SHA-256) | Faster, equally secure, native in Python |
| Fingerprint block (nonce + public_key + checksum) | Tamper detection without full PKI |
| Manifest uses grouped sections | Clear separation: package / tck / compilation |
| `kind: manifest` discriminator | Enables tooling to identify file type without parsing |

---

### 4. Instruction Schema

Each instruction in the `instructions` array follows this schema:

```json
{
  "index": 0,
  "id": "<step_id>",
  "uses": "<step_type>",
  "name": "<human label>",
  "with": { "<param>": "<value or $ref>" },
  "returns": { "<output_name>": { "type": "<type>", "class": "<class>" } },
  "validate": [ { "uses": "validate/...", "with": {...} } ],
  "phase": "setup|steps|teardown",
  "phase_index": 0,
  "on_failure": "abort|continue|skip_remaining"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `index` | integer | Yes | Global position (0-based). Monotonically increasing. |
| `id` | string | Yes | Step identifier (unique within the test). |
| `uses` | string | Yes | Step executor type (e.g., `connector/create_asset`). |
| `name` | string | Yes | Human-readable label for tracing/debugging. |
| `with` | object | Yes | Input parameters. Values are literals or `$ref` objects. |
| `returns` | object | Yes | Declared outputs with type metadata. |
| `validate` | array | No | Inline assertions executed after the step. |
| `phase` | string | Yes | Origin phase: `setup`, `steps`, or `teardown`. |
| `phase_index` | integer | Yes | Position within the phase (for decompilation). |
| `on_failure` | string | Yes | Failure strategy. |

---

### 5. Symbol Table

The symbol table is a flat dictionary providing O(1) lookup for all resolvable values:

```json
{
  "env.provider_url": { "source": "env.variables", "type": "string", "default": "" },
  "env.testlab_dsp_url": { "source": "env.variables", "type": "string", "default": "", "seeded_by": "testlab_connector.dsp_url" },
  "setup.gen_id.generated_id": { "source": "step_output", "produced_by": 0, "type": "string" },
  "env.services.testlab_connector": { "source": "env.services", "produced_by": -1, "type": "class", "class": "ConnectorService" }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `source` | Origin: `env.variables`, `env.services`, `env.schemas`, `env.testdata`, `env.preconditions`, `step_output` |
| `produced_by` | Instruction index that produces this value. `-1` for environment values. Omitted for `env.variables` entries. |
| `type` | Runtime type: `string`, `integer`, `object`, `class` |
| `class` | (Optional) Semantic class: `ConnectorService`, `MockInstance`, `Uuid`, etc. |
| `default` | (Optional) Default value for `env.variables` entries. Empty string if not explicitly set. |
| `seeded_by` | (Optional) `<precondition_id>.<return_field>` — indicates this variable is seeded by a precondition output (see ADR-0013 §10). |

**Invariant:** For any symbol with `produced_by >= 0`, any instruction referencing it via `$ref` must have a higher `index`. No forward references.

---

### 6. `$ref` Resolution

All variable references in the IR use `{ "$ref": "<symbol_key>" }`. The Player resolves by looking up the key in the symbol table, then fetching the runtime value. O(1) — no parsing, no interpolation.

---

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Decoupled compiler/Player**: The IR is a stable contract between the two components.
2. **Tooling ecosystem**: Debuggers, trace viewers, and decompilers can operate on the IR independently.
3. **Single-file execution**: `tck-execution.json` contains everything the Player needs — one read, one parse.
4. **Predictable execution**: Flat instruction array with no branching means deterministic behavior.
5. **Fast symbol resolution**: O(1) lookup at runtime — no scope chain walking.

### Negative

1. **Larger file size**: All tests in one JSON file can be large for big TCKs.
2. **No selective execution from IR alone**: The Player must load all compiled tests even to run one (filtering is done after load).

---

## Supersedes

This ADR supersedes the original single-file-per-test design. All compilation now produces the two-file output described in §2.
