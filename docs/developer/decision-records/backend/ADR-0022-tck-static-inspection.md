# ADR-0022: TCK Static Inspection

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-07-20

## Context

TestLab users and engine backends need to read
metadata from `.tck` and `.stck` packages — Test Name, total step count, total
validation count, and per-step details (name, `uses` identifier, phase) — **without
executing the test**. Use cases include:

- Displaying test metadata in a dashboard or UI before scheduling a run
- Validating that a package contains the expected tests before deploying it
- Generating pre-run reports or conformance summaries

Previously, the only way to extract this information was to execute `testlab run` and
parse the execution trace, which requires a live dataspace environment and leaks no
static summary.

A parallel capability, `Tck.all_variables()` (implemented in
[ADR-0018](../shared/ADR-0018-unified-variables-model.md)), already demonstrates the
correct pattern for extracting static metadata from a loaded `Tck`: a frozen Pydantic
model describes the result, a pure helper function in `scripting/_*.py` performs the
extraction, and the `Tck` class exposes a single method that delegates to it.

## Decision

### 1. Method on `Tck`: `inspect()`

We add `Tck.inspect() -> TckInspectionResult` to `scripting/script.py`, mirroring
the `Tck.all_variables() -> list[VariableDefinition]` pattern exactly:

```
Tck.inspect()
    └── calls build_inspection_result(self)          # scripting/_inspection.py
            └── returns TckInspectionResult          # models/runtime/inspection.py
```

The method works on any loaded `Tck`, whether loaded from a plain `.tck` or a
decrypted `.stck`. Decryption is the caller's responsibility (handled by `Loader`
before `inspect()` is ever called).

### 2. Result models in `models/runtime/inspection.py`

Three frozen Pydantic v2 models capture the static metadata:

```python
class StepMeta(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)
    step_name: str          # step.name if set, otherwise falls back to step.uses
    uses: str               # block identifier (e.g. "connector/consumer/get_catalog")
    phase: StepPhase        # SETUP | EXECUTION | TEARDOWN
    validation_count: int   # number of validate: entries on this step

class ScriptInspection(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)
    name: str
    steps: tuple[StepMeta, ...]

class TckInspectionResult(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)
    name: str
    total_steps: int
    total_validations: int
    scripts: tuple[ScriptInspection, ...]
```

All three are exported through `models/runtime/__init__.py` and `models/__init__.py`
so consumers can import them as:

```python
from tractusx_testlab.models import TckInspectionResult, ScriptInspection, StepMeta
```

### 3. Pure helper in `scripting/_inspection.py`

`build_inspection_result(tck)` iterates all scripts and, for each, maps the three
phase lists (`setup`, `steps`, `teardown`) into `StepMeta` tuples using `_map_steps`.
It computes `total_steps` and `total_validations` by aggregating across all scripts.
The function has no side effects and does not touch the network or filesystem.

### 4. CLI command: `testlab inspect`

A new Typer command in `cli/inspect.py` exposes the feature at the command line:

```
testlab inspect <package> [--player-keys <path>] [--compiler-pub <path>] [--variables] [--infrastructure] [--json]
```

- `<package>` accepts both `.tck` (plain) and `.stck` (encrypted) files.
- `--player-keys` and `--compiler-pub` are required for `.stck` packages; the command
  rejects `.stck` without keys with a clear error message.
- `--variables` flag: additionally prints the variable list returned by `Tck.all_variables()`
  (ID, source, scope, type — as a human-readable table or embedded in the JSON envelope).
- `--infrastructure` flag: additionally prints the infrastructure requirements returned by
  `Tck.infrastructure_requirements()` (capability, side, required flag, standard — as a
  human-readable table or embedded in the JSON envelope).
- Default output: human-readable table printed to stdout.
- `--json` flag: outputs a JSON envelope
  `{"inspection": ..., "variables": [...], "infrastructure": {...}}` — only the sections
  requested via `--variables` / `--infrastructure` are populated in the envelope.

The three sections (`inspection`, `variables`, `infrastructure`) are independently optional.
At least one of the three must be requested or the command prints the inspection table by
default.

### 5. Amendment (2026-07): `Tck.infrastructure_requirements()`

Following the same pattern as `Tck.inspect()` and `Tck.all_variables()`, a method
`Tck.infrastructure_requirements() -> InfrastructureConfig` is added to `scripting/script.py`.

```
Tck.infrastructure_requirements()
    └── calls collect_infrastructure_requirements(self)   # scripting/_infrastructure.py
            └── returns InfrastructureConfig              # models/authoring/infrastructure.py
```

`collect_infrastructure_requirements(tck)` applies a two-pass merge:

1. If the TCK manifest declares a top-level `infrastructure:` block, that block wins as-is.
2. Otherwise, the function iterates all `TestScript` objects and merges their per-script
   `infrastructure:` blocks: `required: true` wins over `required: false`, and the first
   non-`None` `standard` wins.

`InfrastructureConfig`, `CapabilityRequirement`, `Standard`, and `DataspaceContext` are
all exported from `tractusx_testlab.models`:

```python
from tractusx_testlab.models import InfrastructureConfig, CapabilityRequirement, Standard
```

This amendment does **not** change the decision recorded in the original sections. It extends
the pattern documented in § 2 and § 3 with a third static-metadata accessor.

### 6. `StepPhase` enum value rename

The `StepPhase` enum values in `models/primitives/enums.py` are renamed to align
with user-facing and JSON-serialized terminology:

| Old value | New value  |
|-----------|------------|
| `MAIN`    | `EXECUTION` |
| `CLEANUP` | `TEARDOWN`  |
| `SETUP`   | `SETUP` (unchanged) |

This rename is applied to all callers in `player/execution/phases/`.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Backends and UIs can query TCK metadata without provisioning a live dataspace
  environment — significantly reduces onboarding friction.
- The `--json` output of `testlab inspect` provides a stable, machine-readable
  contract for engine integrations.
- Pattern is consistent with `Tck.all_variables()` and `Tck.infrastructure_requirements()` — the
  codebase has one way to extract each kind of static metadata from a loaded `Tck`.
- `--variables` and `--infrastructure` flags give engine backends a complete pre-run picture
  (what the TCK does, what variables it needs, what infrastructure it requires) from a single
  `testlab inspect` call.
- `StepPhase` values now match the domain language (`EXECUTION`, `TEARDOWN`) and
  serialize correctly to JSON without needing a display mapping.

### Negative

- `StepPhase.MAIN` and `StepPhase.CLEANUP` are removed — any downstream code
  (outside this repository) that imported these enum members must be updated to
  `StepPhase.EXECUTION` and `StepPhase.TEARDOWN`.

### Neutral

- No REST API endpoints are added. The feature is library-level (`tck.inspect()`)
  and CLI-level (`testlab inspect`). Engine backends consume the library directly.
- `testlab inspect` on an `.stck` file performs full decryption in memory to load
  the `Tck` object; no intermediate cleartext is written to disk.
