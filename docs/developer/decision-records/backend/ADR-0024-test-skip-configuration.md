# ADR-0024: Test-Level Skip Configuration

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-07-20

## Context

TCK authors occasionally need to mark certain tests as *optional* — tests that cover
features the SUT may not yet support or optional capabilities that are not required for
conformance. Operators running these TCKs need a safe, explicit way to bypass those
tests at runtime without modifying the TCK package itself.

Before this ADR there was no mechanism for this. All tests in a TCK always executed.
Operators worked around it by editing the TCK manifest to remove tests — which is a
destructive, non-repeatable change that modifies the package under test.

The requirement is:

1. The TCK **author** decides which tests may be skipped. A test that is not explicitly
   marked skippable can never be skipped — this prevents accidental or malicious
   bypassing of conformance requirements.
2. The **operator** provides the list of tests to skip at runtime, using an existing
   mechanism (`--var` or a config YAML), not a new CLI flag.
3. A skipped test must produce a **distinct, identifiable result** (`SKIPPED`) so that
   reports and dashboards can distinguish it from both passing (`COMPLETED`) and
   failing (`FAILED`) tests.
4. **Validation happens before the run starts.** An invalid or disallowed skip request
   must raise an error before any test executes, not mid-run.

## Decision

### 1. `TckTestEntry.skippable: bool = False`

A new opt-in field on `TckTestEntry` (in `models/authoring/definitions.py`). Default
is `False` — tests are **not** skippable unless the author explicitly sets
`skippable: true` in the TCK manifest.

```yaml
tests:
  - id: catalog_policy_validation.yaml
    name: Validate catalog policy constraints
    skippable: true        # operator may skip this at runtime
  - id: request_certificate.yaml
    name: Request a certificate
                           # skippable omitted → defaults to false
```

### 2. `skip_tests` runtime variable

The operator provides the list of tests to skip via the standard `runtime_vars`
mechanism — no new CLI flag is introduced:

```bash
# Single test — via --var
testlab run index.yaml --var skip_tests=catalog_policy_validation.yaml

# Multiple tests — via config YAML (--var overwrites; use config for lists)
# skip-config.yaml:
#   skip_tests:
#     - catalog_policy_validation.yaml
#     - error_handling.yaml
testlab run index.yaml --config skip-config.yaml
```

`skip_tests` accepts either a single string or a list of strings. These are test file
IDs (`TckTestEntry.id`), not display names.

### 3. Pre-run validation via `resolve_skip_ids()`

Before any test executes, the player calls `resolve_skip_ids(tck, runtime_vars)`
(in `player/execution/_skip.py`). This function:

- Returns a `frozenset[str]` of validated IDs if all checks pass.
- Raises `SkipNotAllowedError` if any requested ID is:
  - **Unknown** — not present in the TCK's test list.
  - **Not skippable** — present but `skippable: false` (the default).

Validation happens once before the first test runs. Mid-run partial failures are not
possible.

### 4. `ScriptStatus.SKIPPED`

A new value on the `ScriptStatus` enum. Used exclusively for tests that were
intentionally skipped by the operator. It is semantically distinct from:

- `FAILED` — test ran and did not pass.
- `CANCELLED` — run was aborted externally.
- `COMPLETED` — test ran and passed.

`build_tck_result` treats `SKIPPED` as non-failing: an overall TCK is `COMPLETED`
when all scripts are either `COMPLETED` or `SKIPPED`. A single `FAILED` script makes
the entire TCK `FAILED`.

### 5. `SkipNotAllowedError` domain exception

New exception in `models/primitives/exceptions.py`, exported via `models/__init__.py`.
Includes the list of invalid IDs and the reason (unknown vs. not skippable).

### 6. Visibility in `testlab inspect`

`ScriptInspection` gains a `skippable: bool = False` field.  `testlab inspect` shows a
`Skippable: Yes / No` column for each test. The `--json` envelope includes
`"skippable": true/false` per script entry.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Authors retain full control: only explicitly opted-in tests can be skipped.
- Validation is strict and early — operators learn about invalid requests before any
  test runs, not after partial execution.
- `SKIPPED` is a first-class result status — dashboards, reports, and the engine can
  distinguish it from failures without special-casing.
- No new CLI flags are needed — `skip_tests` uses the existing `--var` / config YAML
  mechanism operators already know.

### Negative / Trade-offs

- Skip-by-ID means the operator must know the exact file IDs (`catalog_policy_validation.yaml`),
  not display names. This is intentional — display names are non-unique.
- Repeating `--var skip_tests=...` multiple times on the CLI overwrites the value;
  operators must use a config YAML to skip more than one test at a time. This is a
  limitation of the existing `--var` mechanism, not of this ADR.
