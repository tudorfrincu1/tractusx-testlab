# ADR-0016: Execution Trace Format — CloudEvents Hybrid Envelope

## Status

Proposed

## Date

2026-05-28

## Context

The TestLab player emits execution traces for:

- **Observability**: streaming progress to the IDE via SSE
- **Debugging**: inspecting step-level inputs, outputs, and validation results
- **Audit**: immutable record of what ran, what passed, and what failed
- **Tooling**: log aggregator ingestion (ELK, Loki, Datadog) without custom transformers

Traces are delivered to the IDE frontend over Server-Sent Events (SSE) and persisted as JSONL files. The format must be self-contained, streamable, and interoperable with existing observability infrastructure.

The previous v2 format (flat JSONL with a header line) coupled trace identity to file-level context, making it unsuitable for single-stream TCK runs where multiple tests and lifecycle phases interleave. A CloudEvents-based envelope provides per-event identity, standard typing, and ecosystem compatibility.

!!! note "Prerequisites are Variables, not Preconditions"
    Everything a test needs before its steps run is a **Variable** (see
    [ADR-0018](../shared/ADR-0018-unified-variables-model.md) and
    [ADR-0021](../shared/ADR-0021-remove-precondition-concept.md)). The separate precondition
    concept was removed. The trace therefore emits `tck.variable.*` resolution events
    (not `tck.precondition.*`), and infrastructure that the engine or SUT must provide is
    validated as a **binding** at boot (`tck.boot.binding.*`, see
    [ADR-0019](ADR-0019-service-requirements-and-engine-bindings.md)).

## Decision

Every trace line is a **CloudEvents v1.0** JSON object with domain-specific extensions (`sequence`, nested `data`). The format is a hybrid: CloudEvents envelope for interoperability, domain `data` for TestLab semantics.

### Envelope Fields

| Field | Type | Source | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| `specversion` | `"1.0"` | Fixed | CloudEvents spec version |
| `id` | `string` | Computed | Structured path ID (see below) |
| `source` | `string` | Step `uses` | Emitting component (step type or lifecycle source) |
| `type` | `string` | Event verb | Lifecycle event type from the taxonomy |
| `time` | `string (ISO 8601)` | Clock | Event emission timestamp |
| `sequence` | `integer` | Counter | Global monotonic counter (1-based across the entire TCK run) |
| `data` | `object` | Domain | Event-specific payload |

### The `id` Convention

Event IDs encode structural context as path segments:

| Scope | Format | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| TCK lifecycle | `<tckid>/<type>/<hash>` | `cert-mgmt-tck/tck.start/a3f8c1d27e4b` |
| Boot binding | `<tckid>/infrastructure/<side>.<capability>/<type>/<hash>` | `cert-mgmt-tck/infrastructure/engine.connector/tck.boot.binding.passed/c5f0b3d42e8a` |
| Boot service | `<tckid>/infrastructure/<side>.<capability>/<type>/<hash>` | `cert-mgmt-tck/infrastructure/engine.connector/tck.boot.service.ready/d6a1c4e53f9b` |
| Variable | `<tckid>/env/variables/<varname>/<type>/<hash>` | `cert-mgmt-tck/env/variables/sut_connector/tck.variable.resolved/6f3ad5c128e4` |
| Test lifecycle | `<tckid>/<testid>/<type>/<hash>` | `cert-mgmt-tck/catalog-policy-validation/tck.test.passed/c59034276e4a` |
| Test step | `<tckid>/<testid>/<stepid>/<type>/<hash>` | `cert-mgmt-tck/catalog-policy-validation/pull_data_1/tck.test.step.passed/b48f2a165d39` |

The trailing `<hash>` is a 12-character hex string (blake2b of `data`) that disambiguates emissions with otherwise identical paths.

### The `source` Convention

| Context | Source value | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Step execution | Step's `uses` value | `connector/pull_data_filtered`, `validate/assert` |
| Variable resolution | Variable's `uses` value, or `testlab/player/variables` | `config/connector/policy`, `testlab/player/variables` |
| TCK lifecycle | `testlab/player/lifecycle` | — |
| Boot / binding | `testlab/player/boot` | — |

### Type Taxonomy

#### TCK Lifecycle Events

| `type` | `data` shape | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `tck.start` | `{tck_id, namespace, metadata, environment, service, run_id}` | TCK run begins |
| `tck.boot.start` | `{manifest, compiler_version}` | Boot phase begins |
| `tck.boot.requirements` | `{dataspace, infrastructure}` | Declares the required/optional capabilities per side |
| `tck.boot.binding.start` | `{side, capability}` | Binding validation begins (`side` ∈ `engine` \| `sut`) |
| `tck.boot.binding.passed` | `{side, capability, outputs, duration_ms}` | Binding reachable and valid |
| `tck.boot.binding.failed` | `{side, capability, errors, duration_ms}` | Binding missing or unreachable |
| `tck.boot.service.start` | `{side, capability}` | Engine starts the service backing a capability |
| `tck.boot.service.ready` | `{side, capability, outputs?, duration_ms}` | Service started and ready |
| `tck.boot.service.failed` | `{side, capability, errors, duration_ms}` | Service failed to start |
| `tck.boot.passed` | `{duration_ms, assets_resolved, bindings, services}` | Boot succeeded |
| `tck.boot.failed` | `{duration_ms, errors}` | Boot failed |
| `tck.tests.planned` | `{tests: [<test_id>, ...]}` | Ordered test execution plan |
| `tck.end` | `{status, total, passed, failed, skipped, duration_ms, labels}` | TCK run complete |

#### Boot Requirements Event

`tck.boot.requirements` is emitted once, right after `tck.boot.start`, before any binding or
service. It publishes the resolved topology (ADR-0019) so the operator and the IDE know up front
what each side must provide — e.g. that the SUT must expose **both** a connector and a DTR. Each
capability carries its `required` flag: `true` is **enabled** (the run needs it), `false` is
**disabled** (declared but not exercised this run). The shape mirrors the manifest `infrastructure:`
block exactly:

```json
{
  "dataspace": { "ecosystem": "Catena-X", "version": "saturn" },
  "infrastructure": {
    "engine": { "connector": { "required": true }, "dtr": { "required": false } },
    "sut":    { "connector": { "required": true }, "dtr": { "required": true } }
  }
}
```

A capability with `required: true` is then either validated as a binding (engine side) or resolved
as a variable (SUT side); a `required: false` capability emits no further boot events.

#### Boot Binding Events

Every required `infrastructure.<side>.<capability>` (ADR-0019) is validated and **injected** at
boot, one `tck.boot.binding.*` triple per capability. Engine-side bindings (the EDC connector and
the DTR) are resolved from the operator binding profile and injected into the player here — this is
the single place the concrete EDC/DTR configuration enters the run. Steps never carry it (ADR-0019
§4); they reference only variables, and the player drives the injected engine service implicitly.

`tck.boot.binding.passed.outputs` records the **resolved, non-secret** configuration so the run is
reproducible from the trace alone:

| Engine capability | Typical `outputs` (clear) | Encrypted (`$jwe`) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| `connector` | `status`, `version`, `dsp_url`, `management_url`, `bpn` | `auth` (api key / client secret / token) |
| `dtr` | `status`, `version`, `base_url` | `auth` (api key / OAuth2 client secret) |

Secret binding fields (`auth`, `api_key`, `client_secret`, credentials) are **never** emitted in
clear — they are JWE-encrypted under a `$jwe` key per [Secret Protection](#secret-protection),
exactly like sensitive step outputs. A `tck.boot.binding.failed` carries `errors` only, no config.

#### Boot Service Events

A **binding** validates and injects an *external* endpoint; a **service** is the engine-operated
component the player *starts* per run to drive that capability — for example the engine's connector
client that uses the injected EDC config. A service is addressed by the **same**
`infrastructure.<side>.<capability>` path as its binding (ADR-0019), exactly as written in the
manifest YAML: `{side, capability}` in `data`, `infrastructure/<side>.<capability>` in the `id`. The
same capability therefore appears once under `bindings` (its endpoint was validated) and once under
`services` (its client was started). A service `start` follows the binding it depends on (the client
needs its injected config first).

The **mock server is part of the testlab backend**, not a per-run service: it is already running
before any run begins, so it emits **no** `tck.boot.service.*` events and never appears in
`tck.boot.passed.services`. Its endpoints surface where they are used, not as a boot service.

| Capability | `start` data | `ready` data |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| `engine.connector` | `{side: "engine", capability: "connector"}` | `{side, capability, outputs: {status}, duration_ms}` |

Any secret in service `outputs` follows the same `$jwe` rule. `tck.boot.passed` then lists
`bindings` (validated endpoints) and `services` (started components) separately, both addressed as
`infrastructure.<side>.<capability>`.

#### Variable Resolution Events

Prerequisites resolve in a single phase before tests, after boot. Each variable resolves to
exactly one **disposition** (`known` \| `request` \| `generate`, see
[ADR-0018](../shared/ADR-0018-unified-variables-model.md)). The `input.*` events fire only for the
`request` disposition.

| `type` | `data` shape | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `tck.variable.resolve.start` | `{name, uses?, disposition, schema?}` | Variable resolution begins |
| `tck.variable.resolve.update` | `{name, state, ...context}` | Progress (long-running) |
| `tck.variable.resolved` | `{name, disposition, outputs, duration_ms}` | Variable resolved |
| `tck.variable.resolve.failed` | `{name, errors, duration_ms}` | Resolution failed |
| `tck.variable.resolve.skipped` | `{name, reason}` | Variable not needed |
| `tck.variable.input.required` | `{name, schema, prompt, correlation_id, input_prompts}` | Blocked on operator input |
| `tck.variable.input.received` | `{name, correlation_id, outputs}` | Operator input received |

#### Config Variable Schema

A variable bound to a **config capability** that publishes a config schema carries a `schema`
reference in its resolution events. Today this is `config/connector/policy`: the policy a test
must configure (e.g. the SUT access/usage policy) is a complex variable
([ADR-0018](../shared/ADR-0018-unified-variables-model.md)) whose value validates against the Catena-X policy
JSON Schema shipped in `ide/schemas/policies/`, selected by the run's `dataspace_version`:

| `dataspace_version` | Config schema `$id` |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| `saturn` | `https://w3id.org/catenax/2025/9/policy/schema/atomic-constraint-schemas.json` |
| `jupiter` | `urn:tractusx:testlab:policy:jupiter` |

The `schema` field is always a JSON-Schema **reference** — `{"$ref": "<config schema $id>"}` — never
an inline ad-hoc copy. Author, operator, and trace therefore validate the policy against one source
of truth (the same variables config schema the IDE authoring uses). It maps by disposition:

- `known` / `generate` — `tck.variable.resolve.start` carries `schema`, declaring the config schema
  the provided or generated `value` validates against.
- `request` — `tck.variable.input.required` carries that same config-schema `$ref` as its `schema`,
  so the operator UI renders the policy editor from the specified schema, not a hand-written one.

Variables with no published config schema (plain primitives, infrastructure-derived values) omit
`schema` entirely.


#### Test Lifecycle Events

| `type` | `data` shape | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `tck.test.start` | `{test_id}` | Test begins |
| `tck.test.passed` | `{test_id, duration_ms, passed, failed, assertions}` | Test passed |
| `tck.test.failed` | `{test_id, duration_ms, passed, failed, assertions}` | Test failed |
| `tck.test.skipped` | `{test_id, reason}` | Test skipped |

#### Test Setup Events

| `type` | `data` shape | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `tck.test.setup.start` | `{attempt}` | Start new setup like mock for example |

#### Test Step Events

| `type` | `data` shape | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `tck.test.step.start` | `{attempt}` | Step execution begins |
| `tck.test.step.update` | `{attempt, state, ...context}` | Progress (long-running) |
| `tck.test.step.passed` | `{attempt, duration_ms, outputs, validations}` | Step succeeded (terminal) |
| `tck.test.step.failed` | `{attempt, duration_ms, outputs?, validations, errors}` | Step failed (terminal) |
| `tck.test.step.skipped` | `{attempt, reason}` | Step skipped |
| `tck.test.step.timeout` | `{attempt, duration_ms, timeout_ms}` | Step timed out |
| `tck.test.step.retry` | `{attempt, previous_attempt, reason}` | Retry initiated |

### Nested Validations

Validations are **nested inside the terminal step event** in `data.validations[]`. They are NOT separate CloudEvents. Each validation element:

```json
{
  "source": "validate/assert",
  "field": "edr_token",
  "inputs": {"assertion": "not_null", "expected": null},
  "outputs": {"actual": "...", "passed": true},
  "errors": []
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `source` | `string` | Validation step's `uses` value |
| `field` | `string` | Output field being validated from specific step |
| `inputs` | `object` | Assertion type + expected value |
| `outputs` | `object` | Actual value + `passed` boolean |
| `errors` | `array` | Present only on validation failure (with recommendations) |

**Rationale**: Validations are semantically part of the step result, not independent events. Nesting reduces event count and keeps the step result self-contained for IDE rendering.

### Retry Handling

When a step is retried:

1. A `tck.test.step.retry` event fires with `{attempt: N, previous_attempt: N-1, reason: "..."}`
2. A new `tck.test.step.start` fires with `{attempt: N}`
3. The terminal event carries `{attempt: N, ...}` indicating which attempt produced the result

All attempts share the same `<tckid>/<testid>/<stepid>/` prefix — the trailing hash disambiguates.

### Secret Protection

All sensitive fields are encrypted using **standard JWE compact serialization** (RFC 7516) with `alg: "dir"` and `enc: "A256GCM"`. This is the single way secrets are protected — there is no redaction fallback.

Encryption applies to any output field marked sensitive (e.g. tokens, credentials) **and** any input field with `class: "secret"` (see [ADR-0017](ADR-0017-input-callback-endpoint.md)).

An encrypted field carries a JWE compact serialization string under a `$jwe` key. A JWE compact token is a 5-part base64url dotted string (`header.encrypted_key.iv.ciphertext.tag`; the `encrypted_key` segment is empty for `dir`):

```json
{
  "edr_token": {
    "$jwe": "eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMjU2R0NNIiwia2lkIjoibG9jYWwtMjAyNi0wNS0yOCJ9..<iv>.<ciphertext>.<tag>"
  }
}
```

The `$jwe` field holds the JWE compact serialization string. Its protected header carries `alg`, `enc`, and `kid` (key id) — the `kid` enables rotation.

**Key management**: Keys are stored as a standard **JWKS** file (`~/.testlab/keys.jwks`, chmod 600) for local dev; CI provides the key via `TESTLAB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (registered as a masked secret). The JWK `kid` enables rotation — old keys decrypt old traces.

**Library**: Python `jwcrypto` (built on `cryptography`; full JWE/JWK support).

> AES-GCM nonce uniqueness is handled by the JWE library per-encryption.

### Error Structure with Recommendations

Errors appear in two places:
- `data.errors[]` on the step event (step-level failures)
- `data.validations[].errors[]` on individual validation failures

Each error object:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `code` | `string` | Yes | Machine-readable code (e.g. `NEGOTIATION_TIMEOUT`) |
| `message` | `string` | Yes | Human-readable: what failed, expected vs actual |
| `retryable` | `bool` | Yes | Whether the step can be retried |
| `context` | `object` | No | Diagnostic data (IDs, states, durations) |
| `recommendations` | `array` | No | Actionable suggestions from `recommendations.yaml` |

#### Recommendation Resolution Order

On failure, the player resolves recommendations by merging (deduplicated by `id`):

1. `<error.code>` — most specific (e.g. `NEGOTIATION_TIMEOUT`)
2. `validation:<type>` — validation assertion type (e.g. `validation:equals`)
3. `step:<uses>` — step type (e.g. `step:connector/pull_data_filtered`)

#### `recommendations.yaml` Configuration

```yaml
# By error code
NEGOTIATION_TIMEOUT:
  - id: check-policy-match
    message: "Verify the SUT's access policy accepts your BPN and usage purpose"
    docs: "https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/tutorials/policy-troubleshooting"
  - id: increase-timeout
    message: "Increase negotiation timeout via 'negotiation_timeout_ms' in test config"
    config: negotiation_timeout_ms

# By step type
step:connector/pull_data_filtered:
  - id: verify-dct-type
    message: "Confirm the catalog filter dct:type matches the SUT asset registration"

# By validation type
validation:equals:
  - id: inspect-actual-vs-expected
    message: "Compare outputs.actual against inputs.expected in the trace"
```

### Variable Input Flow

When a `request`-disposition variable needs operator input:

1. Player emits `tck.variable.input.required` with `correlation_id`, `schema`, `prompt`, and `input_prompts`
2. SSE stream **pauses server-side** — no further events until input arrives
3. IDE renders a form from `input_prompts`; user submits via REST endpoint (out of scope — see ADR-0017)
4. Player emits `tck.variable.input.received` echoing `correlation_id` + `outputs`
5. Player emits `tck.variable.resolved` and streaming resumes

The `correlation_id` links the request to the response, enabling the backend to match submissions to pending variables.

### SSE Transport Mapping

Each JSONL line maps to one SSE frame:

| SSE field | Source | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `event:` | `type` value | Routes to IDE event handler |
| `id:` | `sequence` (string) | Enables `Last-Event-ID` reconnection |
| `data:` | Full CE JSON (one line) | Self-contained event payload |

**Reconnection**: IDE sends `Last-Event-ID: <sequence>` on reconnect. Backend resumes from `sequence + 1`. The `tck.start` event is re-sent on every new connection so late joiners have run context.

## Concrete Example

See [`docs/examples/certificate-management-v2/plain/execution-trace.jsonl`](../../../examples/certificate-management-v2/plain/execution-trace.jsonl) for a full 34-event TCK trace.

**TCK start** (sequence 1):
```json
{"specversion":"1.0","id":"certificate-management-tck/tck.start/a3f8c1d27e4b",
 "source":"testlab/player/lifecycle","type":"tck.start",
 "time":"2026-05-28T18:30:00.000Z","sequence":1,
 "data":{"tck_id":"certificate-management-tck","namespace":"ccm-v0.0.1",
  "metadata":{"name":"Certificate Management TCK","version":"v0.0.1",

  "environment":"local","service":"tractusx-testlab",
  "run_id":"a3f8c1d2-7e4b-4a9f-b5c6-2d1e8f9a0b3c"}}
```

**Input-required pause** (sequences 9–10, ~45s gap):
```json
{"specversion":"1.0","id":"...tck.variable.input.required/4d18b3af06c2",
 "source":"testlab/player/variables","type":"tck.variable.input.required",
 "time":"2026-05-28T18:30:00.530Z","sequence":9,
 "data":{"name":"sut_connector","correlation_id":"inp-sut-conn-01",
  "prompt":"Provide SUT connector details","input_prompts":[...]}}

{"specversion":"1.0","id":"...tck.variable.input.received/5e29c4b017d3",
 "source":"testlab/player/variables","type":"tck.variable.input.received",
 "time":"2026-05-28T18:30:45.090Z","sequence":10,
 "data":{"name":"sut_connector","correlation_id":"inp-sut-conn-01",
  "outputs":{"counter_party_address":"https://sut-connector.example.com/api/v1/dsp",
   "counter_party_id":"BPNL000000000SUT"}}}
```

**Step passed with nested validations** (sequence 16):
```json
{"specversion":"1.0","id":"...pull_data_1/tck.test.step.passed/b48f2a165d39",
 "source":"connector/pull_data_filtered","type":"tck.test.step.passed",
 "time":"2026-05-28T18:30:47.738Z","sequence":16,
 "data":{"attempt":1,"duration_ms":2538,
  "outputs":{"asset_id":"urn:asset:ccm-api-3.0",
   "edr_token":{"$jwe":"eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMjU2R0NNIiwia2lkIjoibG9jYWwtMjAyNi0wNS0yOCJ9..<iv>.<ct>.<tag>"}},
  "validations":[
   {"source":"validate/assert","field":"edr_token",
    "inputs":{"assertion":"not_null"},"outputs":{"passed":true}},
   {"source":"validate/assert","field":"dataplane_url",
    "inputs":{"assertion":"not_null"},"outputs":{"passed":true}}]}}
```

**Failed step with recommendations** (sequence 20):
```json
{"specversion":"1.0","id":"...send_request_1/tck.test.step.failed/f8c367508a7d",
 "source":"connector/pull_data_filtered","type":"tck.test.step.failed",
 "time":"2026-05-28T18:31:17.801Z","sequence":20,
 "data":{"attempt":1,"duration_ms":30000,
  "validations":[{"source":"validate/assert","field":"status_code",
   "inputs":{"assertion":"equals","expected":200},
   "outputs":{"actual":null,"passed":false},
   "errors":[{"code":"NEGOTIATION_TIMEOUT",
    "message":"Contract negotiation did not reach AGREED state within 30s",
    "retryable":true,
    "recommendations":[
     {"id":"check-policy-match","message":"Verify the SUT's access policy..."},
     {"id":"increase-timeout","message":"Increase timeout...","config":"negotiation_timeout_ms"},
     {"id":"verify-dct-type","message":"Confirm catalog filter dct:type..."}]}]}],
  "errors":[{"code":"NEGOTIATION_TIMEOUT","retryable":true,
   "message":"Contract negotiation did not reach AGREED state within 30s"}]}}
```

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Reason for Rejection |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Flat JSONL with header line (v2) | Header couples identity to file; doesn't support single-stream TCK runs |
| Separate validation events | Inflates event count; validations are semantically part of the step result |
| UUID v4 for `id` field | Opaque — no structural context; harder to filter/grep |
| Full-line encryption | Breaks log aggregator indexing — non-sensitive fields become unsearchable |
| Custom `$encrypted` wrapper | Reinvents JWE (RFC 7516); standard JWE compact gives library support, JWK key rotation, and interoperability |
| `[REDACTED]` redaction strategy | Irreversibly discards debug-valuable data; JWE encryption protects secrets while remaining recoverable with the key |
| OpenTelemetry spans | Requires OTel collector infrastructure; overkill for file-based traces |
| Protobuf encoding | Not human-readable; cannot `cat` or `jq` the trace |
| Two-file split (TCK + per-test) | Adds complexity; single-stream is simpler for IDE consumption and SSE delivery |

## Consequences

### Positive

- Standard CloudEvents envelope enables integration with any CE-compatible tooling
- Structured `id` enables filtering by TCK, test, step, or event type via simple string prefix
- Self-contained events — no header dependency; any line is independently meaningful
- Nested validations keep step results atomic for IDE rendering
- `sequence` provides total ordering and SSE reconnection support
- Standard JWE (RFC 7516) encryption is the single mechanism for secret protection; `kid`-based JWK rotation keeps old traces decryptable
- Recommendation resolution order provides increasingly specific fix suggestions

### Negative

- Larger per-event overhead (~100 bytes envelope) vs flat format
- Consumers must parse CloudEvents envelope before accessing domain data
- `id` path convention requires understanding the format — not standard CE

### Neutral

- No backward compatibility with v2 format — clean break (no v2 consumers exist in production)
- Performance impact negligible (~1μs envelope construction vs ms-scale step execution)
