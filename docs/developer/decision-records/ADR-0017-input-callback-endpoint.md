# ADR-0017: Input Callback Endpoint

## Status

Proposed

## Date

2026-05-29

## Context

ADR-0016 defines `tck.precondition.input.required` and `tck.precondition.input.received` CloudEvents for interactive precondition inputs. The SSE stream is unidirectional (server→client); a client→server channel is needed for the IDE to submit values back.

Requirements: no external infrastructure, in-process signaling via `asyncio.Future`, field validation, anti-replay protection, and support for partial submissions. The previous correlation_id approach is replaced by a JWT-based callback token that bundles correlation, authorization, and integrity into a single artifact.

## Decision

### Endpoint

```
POST /api/v1/runs/{run_id}/inputs
```

**Headers:**

| Header | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Authorization: Bearer <OAuth token>` | Identity (who is calling) |
| `X-Callback-Token: <JWT>` | Correlation + authorization (which input, proof of delivery) |

**Request body** (`InputSubmission`):

```json
{
  "values": {
    "counter_party_id": "BPNL000000000SUT",
    "counter_party_address": "https://sut-connector.example.com/api/v1/dsp"
  }
}
```

No correlation field in the body — the JWT **is** the correlation.

**Responses:**

| Code | Condition | Body |
|------|-----------|------|
| 202 | Accepted (partial or complete) | `{received: [], pending: []}` |
| 403 | Invalid/expired JWT or nonce not pending | |
| 404 | `run_id` unknown | |
| 409 | All fields already submitted (nonce consumed) | |
| 422 | Values fail field validation | `{error, details}` |

### Security Model — Three Layers

| Layer | Mechanism | Protects Against |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Identity | OAuth Bearer token | Unauthenticated access |
| Integrity | JWT HS256 signature | Token tampering |
| Authorization | blake2b nonce (delivered only via authenticated SSE) | Replay, unauthorized submission by other authenticated users |

The nonce is only delivered inside the `input.required` SSE event on an authenticated stream. Only the user connected to that run can obtain it.

### JWT Callback Token

- **Algorithm**: HS256
- **Signing key**: Server-side secret (per-run)
- **Claims** (JWT carries field names only — full typed schema is in the SSE event):

```json
{
  "run_id": "run-abc-123",
  "name": "sut_connection_details",
  "fields": ["counter_party_id", "counter_party_address"],
  "nonce": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...32hex",
  "iat": 1748505600,
  "exp": 1748505900
}
```

### Nonce Generation

16 random bytes → blake2b digest → 32 hex characters. Backend stores `_pending[(run_id, nonce)]` → `PendingInput`. Nonce is popped only when **all** fields are submitted (not on first partial).

### One Input Per Precondition

- 1 precondition = 1 `input.required` event = 1 nonce = 1 JWT
- All fields that precondition needs are bundled in one event
- Multiple preconditions emit their own events sequentially

### Field Schema

Each field in the `input.required` event carries metadata for automatic form generation:

| Attribute | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | ✅ | Data type: `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `json` |
| `class` | ❌ | Semantic class: `bpn`, `url`, `secret`, `enum`, `uuid`, `date` |
| `label` | ✅ | Human-readable display name for the form |
| `options` | ❌ | Allowed values (only when `class: "enum"`) |

**Example in `input.required` event data:**

```json
"fields": {
  "counter_party_id": { "type": "string", "class": "bpn", "label": "Counter Party ID" },
  "counter_party_address": { "type": "string", "class": "url", "label": "Counter Party Address" }
}
```

The IDE maps this to form controls:

| `type` | Control |
|--------|--------|
| `string` | Text input |
| `integer` | Number input |
| `boolean` | Toggle |
| `json` | Code editor (Monaco) |

The `class` adds validation and formatting hints:

| `class` | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `bpn` | Pattern: `BPN[LSA]\d{12}` |
| `url` | URL format validation |
| `secret` | Masked input; encrypted via JWE in traces (see ADR-0016) |
| `enum` | Dropdown from `options[]` |
| `uuid` | UUID format |
| `date` | Date picker |

The JWT `fields` claim remains a **name-only list** for lightweight validation at the REST handler. The full typed schema lives only in the SSE event data.

### Partial Submission

Same JWT can be POSTed multiple times until all fields are filled. Each POST merges values into accumulated state. Re-submitting a field overwrites the previous value (allowed before completion).

### Event Types

| Event | Payload |
|-------|---------|
| `tck.precondition.input.required` | `fields{} (typed map), callback_url, callback_token, warn_after_s, fail_after_s` |
| `tck.precondition.input.received` | `received[], pending[], values` |
| `tck.precondition.input.warning` | `pending[], timeout_remaining_s` |
| `tck.precondition.input.timeout` | `missing[]` |

### Internal Mechanism — InputManager

```python
@dataclass
class PendingInput:
    nonce: str
    name: str
    required_fields: set[str]
    received_values: dict[str, Any]
    future: asyncio.Future
    warn_after: float
    fail_after: float

class InputManager:
    _pending: dict[tuple[str, str], PendingInput]  # keyed on (run_id, nonce)

    def request(self, run_id, nonce, name, fields, warn_after, fail_after) -> asyncio.Future
    def submit(self, run_id, nonce, values) -> SubmitResult  # SubmitResult(complete, received, pending)
    def cancel_all(self, reason: str) -> None
```

`submit()` merges values, checks if all fields present, resolves Future only when complete.

### Player Integration

1. Precondition executor generates nonce, creates JWT, calls `input_manager.request()`
2. Emits `input.required` with `callback_url` + `callback_token`
3. Awaits Future; starts warn timer and fail timer concurrently
4. On warn timeout → emits `input.warning`, continues waiting
5. On fail timeout → emits `input.timeout`, raises `PreconditionError`

### REST Handler Validation Flow

1. Decode JWT from `X-Callback-Token` → extract `run_id`, `nonce`, `fields`, `exp`
2. Verify signature → 403 if invalid
3. Check `exp` → 403 if expired
4. Check `run_id` matches URL path → 403 if mismatch
5. Lookup `_pending[(run_id, nonce)]` → 403 if not found
6. Validate value keys ⊆ `fields` claim → 422 if unknown fields
7. Call `input_manager.submit()` → merge values
8. Return 202 with `received[]` and `pending[]`

### Trace Log Example

How the input callback flow appears in the CloudEvents JSONL execution trace:

**1. Input required — player blocks, emits field schema:**
```json
{"specversion":"1.0","id":"ccm-v2/sut_connection_details/request_input/tck.precondition.input.required/a1b2c3d4e5f6","source":"testlab/player/precondition","type":"tck.precondition.input.required","time":"2026-05-29T10:00:00.000Z","data":{"run_id":"run-abc-123","name":"sut_connection_details","fields":{"counter_party_id":{"type":"string","class":"bpn","label":"Counter Party ID"},"counter_party_address":{"type":"string","class":"url","label":"Counter Party Address"}},"callback_url":"/api/v1/runs/run-abc-123/inputs","callback_token":"eyJ...","warn_after_s":120,"fail_after_s":300}}
```
**2. Partial submission received:**
```json
{"specversion":"1.0","id":"ccm-v2/sut_connection_details/request_input/tck.precondition.input.received/b2c3d4e5f6a1","source":"testlab/player/precondition","type":"tck.precondition.input.received","time":"2026-05-29T10:01:12.000Z","data":{"run_id":"run-abc-123","name":"sut_connection_details","received":["counter_party_id"],"pending":["counter_party_address"],"values":{"counter_party_id":"BPNL000000000SUT"}}}
```
**3. Warning timer fired — user hasn't completed submission:**
```json
{"specversion":"1.0","id":"ccm-v2/sut_connection_details/request_input/tck.precondition.input.warning/c3d4e5f6a1b2","source":"testlab/player/precondition","type":"tck.precondition.input.warning","time":"2026-05-29T10:02:00.000Z","data":{"run_id":"run-abc-123","name":"sut_connection_details","pending":["counter_party_address"],"timeout_remaining_s":180}}
```
**4. Final submission — all fields received, precondition unblocks:**
```json
{"specversion":"1.0","id":"ccm-v2/sut_connection_details/request_input/tck.precondition.input.received/d4e5f6a1b2c3","source":"testlab/player/precondition","type":"tck.precondition.input.received","time":"2026-05-29T10:02:30.000Z","data":{"run_id":"run-abc-123","name":"sut_connection_details","received":["counter_party_id","counter_party_address"],"pending":[],"values":{"counter_party_id":"BPNL000000000SUT","counter_party_address":"https://sut-connector.example.com/api/v1/dsp"}}}
```

> **Note:** Fields with `class: "secret"` are **encrypted using JWE** (see [ADR-0016](ADR-0016-execution-trace-format.md) Secret Protection) before being written to the trace — never stored in plaintext. The decrypted value is held only in memory during execution.

### Edge Cases

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| IDE disconnects | SSE reconnects; `input.required` re-sent; same JWT still valid |
| Double-submit after completion | 409 (nonce consumed) |
| Invalid values | 422; player stays blocked; user retries with same token |
| Run cancelled while waiting | `cancel_all()` cancels Futures |
| Partial then timeout | Warning emitted → timeout emitted → precondition fails |
| Re-submit same field | Overwrites previous value (allowed before completion) |
| JWT expired, fields incomplete | 403; precondition will eventually timeout |

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Reason for Rejection |
|-------------|---------------------|
| `correlation_id` in body | JWT nonce is simpler, more secure, no body field needed |
| Token in URL query param | Security risk (logged in access logs); header is safer |
| WebSocket bidirectional | Over-engineered for input collection |
| Shared message queue | Infrastructure dependency; in-process Future suffices for single-node |

## Consequences

### Positive

- Zero external dependencies — pure in-process async signaling
- Three-layer security without added complexity
- Nonce prevents unauthorized submission even by other authenticated users
- Partial submission enables progressive UX
- Warning events give users time to react before failure

### Negative

- Single-node only (Future-based; distributed executor would need a signal bus)
- JWT adds ~200 bytes per event (acceptable)
- Server must track warn/fail timers per pending input

### Neutral

- CI can pre-fill via `--env` flags, bypassing this endpoint entirely
- Local dev can disable OAuth layer (nonce still protects)
