# ADR-0011: Environment and Services Specification

## Status

Draft

## Date

2026-05-21

## Context

Testing against real Tractus-X dataspaces requires configured infrastructure services (connector connectors, DTRs, Discovery Finders) and runtime variables (BPNs, URLs, credentials). ADR-0010 introduced the `env:` block in TCK manifests with service definitions following the step-like pattern (`name` + `uses` + `with`). This ADR formalizes:

- How services are declared, configured, and referenced
- How services produce typed variables for step consumption
- How variables are acquired (static, runtime prompt, auto-generation)
- How secrets are handled
- The scoping rule: tests consume but never declare services or env variables

### Forces

- Certification testers must configure services once per TCK, not per test.
- Some values are known before execution (URLs), some are entered during execution (OTP codes), some are generated (UUIDs).
- The IDE Environment Editor must map 1:1 to the YAML `env:` block.
- Services have different auth mechanisms (API key, OAuth2) depending on type and deployment.
- Secrets must never leak into logs, exports, or YAML serialization.
- Services are steps — they follow the same `uses` + `with` vocabulary as all other blocks.

## Decision

### 1. Services Live at TCK Level Only

All service declarations belong in the TCK manifest under `env.services`. Individual test files (`kind: test`) CANNOT declare their own services. Tests reference services by name via `with: { service: "name" }` or `${{ env.services.name }}`.

**Rationale:** A TCK represents one test environment. Services are infrastructure — they don't change between test cases within the same TCK.

### 2. Service Definition Pattern

Services follow the same pattern as steps: `name` + `uses` + `with`. The `uses` field references a type from the `service/` namespace in the uses registry. The `with` block contains ALL configuration for that service type, including authentication.

```yaml
env:
  services:
    - name: provider
      uses: service/connector_service
      with:
        base_url: ${{ env.provider_url }}
        management_path: /management/v3
        dsp_path: /api/v1/dsp
        dataspace_version: ${{ metadata.dataspace_version }}
        auth:
          type: api_key
          api_key: ${{ env.provider_api_key }}
          api_key_header: "X-Api-Key"
      returns:
        connector_service:
          type: class
          class: ConnectorService
```

**Field specification:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Service identifier. Pattern: `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,49}$`. Becomes the variable handle. |
| `uses` | Yes | Service type from `service/` namespace (e.g., `service/connector_service`). |
| `with` | Yes | Typed inputs for the service, including `auth`. Schema depends on service type. |

### 3. Service Type Registry

Each `uses` value in the `service/` namespace defines its own input schema:

| Uses | Description | Required `with` fields |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| `service/connector_service` | Eclipse Dataspace Connector | `base_url`, `management_path`, `dsp_path`, `dataspace_version`, `auth` |
| `service/mock_server` | TestLab built-in mock server | `port` |
| `service/dtr` | Digital Twin Registry | `base_url`, `lookup_path`, `auth` |
| `service/discovery_service` | Discovery Finder service | `base_url`, `auth` |

### 4. Authentication Inside `with`

Auth is a nested object inside `with:` — not a separate top-level block. Each service type defines whether auth is required or optional.

**API Key:**
```yaml
with:
  base_url: "https://connector.local"
  auth:
    type: api_key
    api_key: ${{ env.provider_api_key }}
    api_key_header: "X-Api-Key"
```

**OAuth2:**
```yaml
with:
  base_url: "https://connector.local"
  auth:
    type: oauth2
    token_url: "https://auth.local/token"
    client_id: ${{ env.client_id }}
    client_secret: ${{ env.client_secret }}
```

**No auth:**
```yaml
with:
  base_url: "http://localhost:4243"
  auth:
    type: none
```

Supported auth types: `api_key`, `oauth2`, `none`.

### 5. Implicit Returns — Services as Typed Variables

Each service **implicitly generates a return variable** when declared. The variable:

- Has the service `name` as its identifier
- Has `type: object`
- Has `class` derived from the `uses` action name (e.g., `service/connector_service` → class `connector_service`)

This means steps that accept a `service` input can use IDE class-based filtering to show only compatible services in their dropdown. For example, a step that expects `class: connector_service` will only show connector services, not mock servers.

**Referencing services in steps:**

```yaml
- id: create_asset_1
  uses: connector/provider/create_asset
  with:
    connector_service: ${{ env.services.provider.connector_service}}                         # 
    asset_id: ${{ vars.generated_id }}
```

The compiler validates that `connector_service: ${{ env.services.provider.connector_service}}` references an existing entry in `env.services`.

### 6. Dataspace Version via Metadata Reference

Services that need the dataspace version reference it from metadata using the `${{ metadata.dataspace_version }}` expression — no duplication:

```yaml
metadata:
  dataspace_version: saturn

env:
  services:
    - name: provider
      uses: service/connector_service
      with:
        base_url: ${{ env.provider_url }}
        dataspace_version: ${{ metadata.dataspace_version }}
        auth:
          type: api_key
          api_key: "test-key"
          api_key_header: "X-Api-Key"
      returns:
        connector_service:
          type: class
          class: ConnectorService
```

### 7. Variable Acquisition Types

Each variable in `env.variables` has a value that may come from different sources:

| Source | Description | Resolution Time |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Static literal | Hardcoded value in YAML | Compile time |
| `${{ execution.x }}` | Injected at runtime | Pre-execution |
| User-prompted | Marked for runtime user input | Mid-execution (pauses) |
| Generated | Auto-generated by runtime function | Pre-execution |

For v1-alpha, all variables are static literals or expression references. Runtime prompting and generation are future extensions (tracked separately).

### 8. Secrets Handling

Variables with `secret: true` in the IDE metadata:

- Are masked in all log output (`***`)
- Are stored in memory only (never written to disk during execution)
- Are excluded from YAML export/serialization of results
- Display as `••••••` in the IDE variable editor

In the YAML, secrets are just regular variables — the `secret` flag is IDE/runtime metadata, not a YAML field.

### 9. Scoping Rule

Tests (`kind: test`) CANNOT declare `env:` blocks. All environment configuration is inherited from the parent TCK manifest via namespace resolution. Tests consume:

- Variables via `${{ env.x }}`
- Services via `with: { service: "name" }` or `${{ env.services.name }}`
- Schemas via `${{ env.schemas.name }}`
- Metadata via `${{ metadata.x }}`

### 10. Resolution Order

Within the `env:` block, resolution follows declaration order:

1. `env.variables` — resolved first (static values and `${{ execution.x }}` references)
2. `metadata.*` — always available (declared above `env:`)
3. `env.services` — resolved second (may reference `env.variables` and `metadata.*`)
4. `env.schemas` / `env.testdata` — resolved last (file path validation)

This means services can reference variables (`${{ env.provider_url }}`), but variables cannot reference services.

## Compiler Validation Rules

| Rule | Error Message |
|------|---------------|
| Service missing `name` | `Service at index {n} is missing required field 'name'` |
| Service missing `uses` | `Service '{name}' is missing required field 'uses'` |
| Service missing `with` | `Service '{name}' is missing required field 'with'` |
| Invalid `uses` namespace | `Service '{name}' uses '{value}' — must start with 'service/'` |
| Unknown service type | `Unknown service type '{value}' in service '{name}'` |
| Duplicate service name | `Duplicate service name '{name}' — first defined at index {n}` |
| Missing required field | `Service '{name}' ({uses}): missing required field '{field}' in 'with'` |
| Step references unknown service | `Step '{id}' references service '{name}' — not defined in env.services` |
| Circular reference | `Circular reference in env: service '{name}' references variable that references service` |

## Consequences

### Positive

- Services follow the same vocabulary as steps (`uses` + `with`) — one pattern to learn
- Typed variables from services enable IDE class-based filtering in dropdowns
- Auth inside `with` means each service type fully defines its own input schema
- `${{ metadata.dataspace_version }}` eliminates duplication across services
- Compile-time validation catches misconfigured services before execution

### Negative

- Tests cannot be self-contained — they always require a parent TCK manifest
- Adding a new service type requires updating the type registry
- `service/` namespace prefix is slightly more verbose than bare type names

### Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Service type proliferation | Registry is curated — new types require ADR amendment |
| Auth credentials in YAML | Secrets handling + IDE masking + never serialize to exports |
| Breaking change from ADR-0011 draft | No production code depends on the draft yet — clean slate |

## Impact on IDE

The Environment Editor maps to the `env:` block:

- **Services panel**: List of services with `uses` type badge and expandable `with` configuration
- **Variables panel**: Key-value table with secret masking toggle
- **Add Service dialog**: type dropdown from `service/` registry, form fields from type schema
- **Service dropdowns in steps**: Filtered by class (only show compatible services)

## Impact on Backend

The runtime handles:

1. **Compile-time**: Validate all service references, required fields, and variable interpolation
2. **Pre-execution**: Resolve `env.variables`, then interpolate into `env.services`
3. **Service instantiation**: Create SDK service objects from resolved service configs
4. **Variable injection**: Service `name` registered as typed variable (`class: {action_name}`)
5. **Secret masking**: Logger filters any value marked as secret from output
