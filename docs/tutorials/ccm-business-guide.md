# Company Certificate Management — Business Guide

This guide explains what the CX-0135 certificate management test suite validates and how to run it — no coding required.

## What This Tests

The Catena-X standard **CX-0135** defines how companies exchange certificates (ISO 9001, IATF 16949, ISO 14001, etc.) through secure data channels. TestLab validates that your company's implementation handles the complete certificate lifecycle correctly.

**Why it matters:** Companies in the Catena-X network must prove compliance. Automated conformity testing catches problems before they block real business transactions.

## The Certificate Lifecycle

CX-0135 defines five mechanisms for exchanging certificates between companies:

    A[Your Company] -- "1 REQUEST" --> B[Supplier]
    B -- "2 PULL" --> A
    A -- "3 FEEDBACK" --> B
    B -- "4 PUSH" --> A
    B -- "5 AVAILABLE" --> A

    style A fill:#0d47a1,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style B fill:#e65100,stroke:#333,color:#fff
```

| Mechanism | What Happens | Business Example |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **REQUEST** | You ask a supplier for a certificate | "Send us your ISO 9001 certificate" |
| **PULL** | You download the certificate through a secure channel | "Download the certificate document" |
| **FEEDBACK** | You confirm receipt and validity of the certificate | "We received your certificate — it's valid" |
| **PUSH** | A supplier proactively sends you a new certificate | "Here's our renewed IATF 16949 certificate" |
| **AVAILABLE** | A supplier notifies you a certificate is ready | "A new ISO 14001 certificate is available" |

All exchanges happen through Eclipse Dataspace Connectors (EDCs) — secure gateways that enforce access policies and data sovereignty.

## What TestLab Validates

The test suite runs 8 scenarios covering the full CX-0135 standard:

| Test | What It Checks | Business Meaning |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Request Certificate | Can your system accept certificate requests? | Suppliers can ask you for certificates |
| Validate Payload | Does the certificate data match the standard format? | Your certificates are machine-readable |
| Await Feedback | Does your system send status callbacks? | Partners know their request is being processed |
| Send Feedback | Can your system receive feedback notifications? | You get confirmation when certificates arrive |
| Push Certificate | Can your system send certificates proactively? | You can distribute new certificates automatically |
| Available Notification | Can your system notify about available certificates? | Partners know when to download new certificates |
| Expose Asset | Can your system publish certificate data for download? | Your certificates are discoverable in the network |
| Error Handling | Does your system reject invalid requests correctly? | Bad requests get clear error responses |

**Pass** (green) = your implementation meets the CX-0135 requirement.
**Fail** (red) = your implementation needs changes before certification.

## Running the Tests

### Step 1: Open the TestLab IDE

Open your browser and navigate to the TestLab IDE (your administrator provides the URL). You see a visual editor with blocks on a canvas.

### Step 2: Load the Certificate Management Example

1. Click **"Example Projects"** in the welcome screen
2. Select **"Certificate Management (CX-0135)"**
3. The editor loads the pre-built test suite with 8 test scenarios

### Step 3: Configure Your Test Environment

Click the **run configuration** panel and fill in your company details:

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|---------------|
| Provider Address | Your EDC connector's DSP endpoint URL |
| Provider BPN | Your company's Business Partner Number (BPNL) |
| Consumer BPN | The test partner's Business Partner Number |

!!! tip "Using the stub for a quick demo"
    You can run the tests against a local stub server without a real EDC connector. See the [Developer Guide](ccm-developer-guide.md) for instructions.

### Step 4: Click Execute

Press the **Execute** button in the toolbar. The IDE sends the test suite to the backend and streams results back in real-time.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You as You (Browser)
    participant IDE as TestLab IDE
    participant Backend as TestLab Backend
    participant SUT as Your System

    You->>IDE: Click Execute
    IDE->>Backend: Submit test suite
    Backend->>SUT: Run test steps
    SUT-->>Backend: Responses
    Backend-->>IDE: Real-time results (SSE)
    IDE-->>You: Green/Red indicators
```

### Step 5: Read the Results

The execution panel shows each test step with a status indicator:

- **Green checkmark** — the step passed
- **Red X** — the step failed (expand for details)
- **Spinner** — the step is running

Each failed step includes an explanation: what was expected, what was received, and what to do next.

## Understanding Failures

| Failure | What It Means | Next Step |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| "Catalog query returned no datasets" | Your EDC connector doesn't advertise a CCMAPI asset | Register a CCMAPI-type asset in your EDC |
| "Contract negotiation failed" | Your access policies rejected the test partner | Check your EDC policies allow the test BPN |
| "Schema validation failed" | Your certificate data is missing required fields | Compare your payload against the CX-0135 v3.1.0 schema |
| "Timed out waiting for callback" | Your system didn't send a status callback | Verify your system sends HTTP callbacks after processing |
| "Unexpected status: REJECTED" | Your system rejected a valid request | Check your validation logic for false rejections |

## Glossary

| Term | Plain-English Meaning |
|------|----------------------|
| **BPN / BPNL** | Business Partner Number — a unique company ID in the Catena-X network |
| **EDC** | Eclipse Dataspace Connector — a secure gateway for data exchange |
| **CCMAPI** | Company Certificate Management API — the standard interface for certificate exchange |
| **DSP** | Dataspace Protocol — the communication standard between EDC connectors |
| **SUT** | System Under Test — your implementation being validated |
| **TCK** | Technology Compatibility Kit — a suite of tests that verifies standard compliance |
| **CX-0135** | The Catena-X standard for company certificate management |
