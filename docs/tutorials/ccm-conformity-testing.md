# CCM Conformity Testing

Run Certificate Credential Management (CCM) conformity tests against a System Under Test (SUT) to verify compliance with the Catena-X CX-0135 standard.

## What is CCM Conformity Testing?

The CX-0135 standard defines how Catena-X participants exchange company certificates (ISO 9001, IATF 16949, etc.) through EDC connectors using the CCMAPI. TestLab provides a ready-made test suite that validates whether your implementation handles the full certificate lifecycle correctly.

**Who should use this guide:**

- Developers implementing a CCMAPI-compliant service
- Quality engineers validating CX-0135 conformity before release
- Test architects adapting this suite as a template for other Catena-X standards

## CCM Test Suite Overview

The suite contains five tests executed in sequence. Each test builds on outputs from previous tests.

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `request_certificate` | Query provider catalog, negotiate contract, POST certificate request |
| `validate_payload` | Fetch certificate and validate against BusinessPartnerCertificate v3.1.0 schema |
| `await_feedback_callback` | Expose callback endpoint; wait for provider to POST status feedback |
| `send_feedback` | Send feedback notification via EDC dataplane; await provider acknowledgment |
| `expose_testlab_asset` | Register CCMAPI asset in TestLab EDC; verify SUT discovers and pulls data |

```

## Test Suite Structure

### Index file and test references

The suite uses an `index.yaml` file that declares metadata, variables, and references individual test files:

```yaml
kind: test-case
name: certificate-management
version: "1.0"

standards:
  - id: CX-0135
    version: "2.4.0"

variables:
  provider_address:
    type: str
    description: Provider EDC DSP endpoint
    runtime: true
  # ... more variables

tests:
  - test: tests/request_certificate.yaml
    description: Query provider catalog for CCMAPI offer
  - test: tests/validate_payload.yaml
    description: Validate certificate payload against schema
```

Each `test:` entry points to a YAML file with `kind: test`. Tests declare dependencies using `depends_on` to share outputs.

### Step types used in CCM

| Step Type | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| `query_catalog` | Discover assets in an EDC connector's catalog |
| `extract_dataset` | Extract asset/offer IDs from a catalog response |
| `negotiate` | Negotiate an EDC contract for an asset |
| `initiate_transfer` | Get dataplane access credentials (EDR token) |
| `http_call` | Make HTTP requests to dataplane endpoints |
| `validate_semantic_schema` | Validate JSON against a SAMM semantic model |
| `json_path_extract` | Extract values from JSON using a path expression |
| `mock_endpoint` | Expose a temporary HTTP endpoint for callbacks |
| `wait_for_call` | Block until a mock endpoint receives a request |
| `create_asset` | Register an asset in an EDC connector |
| `create_policy` | Create an access/contract policy |
| `create_contract_def` | Link an asset to policies via a contract definition |
| `send_notification` | Send a CX notification through the EDC dataplane |
| `generate_uuid` | Generate a random UUID |

### Variable flow between steps

Variables flow through two mechanisms:

1. **`store_in_memory`** — saves step outputs into named variables:

    ```yaml
    store_in_memory:
      contract_agreement_id: "agreement_id"
    ```

2. **`@variable_name`** — references a stored variable in subsequent steps:

    ```yaml
    params:
      agreement_id: "@contract_agreement_id"
    ```

3. **`depends_on`** — shares variables across test files:

    ```yaml
    depends_on:
      - file: tests/request_certificate.yaml
        outputs:
          - request_id
    ```

### Assertions

Each step can include `expect` blocks with four assertion types:

```yaml
expect:
  - output: status_code
    equals: 200              # exact match
  - output: request_id
    not_null: true           # value exists and is not null
  - output: response_body
    not_empty: true          # value is not empty string/list
  - output: value
    equals: "@certificate_type"  # match against a variable
```

### Service configuration

Tests declare EDC connector services with connection details:

```yaml
services:
  - name: provider_edc
    type: edc_connector_saturn
    config:
      management_url: "@provider_address"
```

### Adapting for other standards

To create a test suite for a different Catena-X standard:

1. Copy `ide/public/examples/certificate-management-v1.0/` to a new directory
2. Update `index.yaml`: change `name`, `standards`, and `variables`
3. Replace test files with steps matching your standard's API
4. Keep the same patterns: catalog query → negotiate → transfer → call → assert

## Understanding Test Results

### Exit codes

| Exit Code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0` | All tests passed |
| `1` | One or more assertions failed |

### Reading results programmatically

The `TestCaseResult` object contains the full execution tree:

```
TestCaseResult
├── status: PASSED | FAILED
├── scripts: list[ScriptResult]
│   ├── script_name: "request-certificate"
│   ├── status: PASSED | FAILED
│   ├── assertion_summary: {total, passed, failed_hard, failed_soft}
│   └── steps: list[StepResult]
│       ├── step_name: "POST certificate request"
│       ├── status: PASSED | FAILED
│       ├── error: "Expected 200, got 403"
│       └── assertions: list[AssertionResult]
│           ├── passed: bool
│           ├── expected: 200
│           └── actual: 403
```

### Identifying failures

When a test fails, check these fields on each `StepResult`:

- **`step_name`** — which step failed (matches the `description` in YAML)
- **`step_type`** — what kind of step it was (`http_call`, `negotiate`, etc.)
- **`error`** — human-readable error message
- **`assertions`** — list of individual assertion results with `expected` vs `actual`

## Integrating into Another Application

### Running tests programmatically

```python
import asyncio
from tractusx_testlab.player.execution.player import TestlabPlayer

async def run_ccm_tests():
    player = TestlabPlayer()
    result = await player.run(
        "path/to/certificate-management-v1.0/index.yaml",
        runtime_vars={
            "provider_address": "https://provider-edc.example.com/api/v1/dsp",
            "provider_bpn": "BPNL000000000001",
            "consumer_bpn": "BPNL000000000002",
            "location_bpns": "BPNS000000000001",
            "testlab_management_url": "https://testlab-edc.example.com/management",
            "testlab_dsp_url": "https://testlab-edc.example.com/api/v1/dsp",
        },
    )

    # Check overall result
    print(f"Status: {result.status}")
    print(f"Steps passed: {result.passed}/{result.total}")

    # Inspect individual scripts
    for script in result.scripts:
        summary = script.assertion_summary
        print(f"  {script.script_name}: {script.status}")
        print(f"    Assertions: {summary.passed}/{summary.total} passed")

        # Show failures
        for step in script.steps:
            if step.error:
                print(f"    FAILED: {step.step_name} — {step.error}")

    # CI/CD exit code
    return 0 if result.status.value == "PASSED" else 1

exit_code = asyncio.run(run_ccm_tests())
raise SystemExit(exit_code)
```

### Validating without executing

Use the `Compiler` to validate test YAML syntax before running:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from tractusx_testlab.compiler.compiler import Compiler

compiler = Compiler()
validation = compiler.validate(Path("path/to/index.yaml"))
print(f"Valid: {validation}")
```
